## How to activate environment:

Multiple processes associated with the Diverse Data Hub require the use of a common environment for reproduciblity. For this reason, we've provided a `renv` environment:

The following R packages are used in various analyses and must be installed to render the Quarto website:

```r

# Adding Data Sets form Diverse data hub For All Analysis:

library(diversedata)

# For `Women's March Madness`:

library(tidyverse)
library(AER)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(MASS)

# For `Wildfire` (Additional to what's listed above)

library(lubridate)
library(gt)
library(ggmap)
library(ggspatial)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(maptiles)
library(viridis)
library(marginaleffects)
library(broom)

### To use the `renv` environment included in this repository 

**1. Clone the repository**

Using your shell terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:diverse-data-hub/diverse-data-hub.github.io.git
cd diverse-data-hub.github.io
```

**2. Open the R project**

Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio

Make sure your working directory is set to the project root.

**3. Ensure installation of `renv` package**

If the library `renv` is not installed run the following line in the R console. If already installed, skip to the next step:

```R
install.packages("renv")  
```

**4. Restore the project environment**

Restore the environment (already created with `rev::init()`) in the R console:

```R
renv::restore()
```

This installs the correct package versions from renv.lock.

In case this step throws an error like `Error: This project does not contain a lockfile.`, try the following command to restore the environment:

```R
renv::snapshot()
```

Following the command, restart your R session and retry the `renv::restore()` command-

**5. Confirm renv status**

Close up the R project and reopen it. Check that your environment matches the lockfile and everything is synced running the following in your R console:

```R
renv::status()
```

You should see a message like: *No issues found - the project is in a consistent state.*

**Optional** - To Add New Dependencies

If you add new R packages to a new notebook, run in the R console with the R project opened and the environment restored:

```r
renv::snapshot()
```

**Optional** - To Update Dependencies

1. Open your R project (with renv already initialized)

2. Update the package using either renv::update() or install.packages():

```r
renv::update("packageName")
```

3. Regenerate the lockfile
After the package is updated, regenerate the lockfile:

```r
renv::snapshot()
```

This writes the new package version and source into the renv.lock file, so others can install the exact same version.

**Optional** - To Clean Dependencies

To see which packages are installed but are not used, run in the R console with the R project opened and the environment restored:

```r
renv::clean()
```

This identifies unused packages and offers to remove them.
