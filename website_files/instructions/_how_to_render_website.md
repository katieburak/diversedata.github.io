## How to render the website:

The [Quarto website](https://diverse-data-hub.github.io/) is deployed through GitHub Pages upon every push to `main` branch. However, for updates to be visible on the website, developers must run `quarto render` before merging updates to the `main` branch.

Rendering the website requires `Quarto` to be installed. While Quarto is usually installed with RStudio, Quarto CLI can be downloaded [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

To preview or render the website using `quarto preview` or `quarto render` you must have all used R packages installed. For this reason, we've provided a `renv` environment for easy installation:

**1. Clone the repository**

Using your shell terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:diverse-data-hub/diverse-data-hub.github.io.git
cd diverse-data-hub.github.io
```

**2. Activate Environment**

See instructions [here](https://github.com/diverse-data-hub/diverse-data-hub.github.io/blob/main/website_files/instructions/_how_to_activate_environment.md). 

**3. Preview or Render the Quarto site**

*NOTE:* Rendering time may vary depending on the number of updates applied across multiple files.

Now in your shell console, you can run:

```bash
quarto preview
```

```bash
quarto render
```

Now you are able to render your updates and they will be visible on the website when merged to the `main` branch.

**Note: Your notebook is not rendering your latest updates?**

Quarto uses the `freeze: auto` setting to optimize rendering by only updating files that have changed since the last render.

However, if a child `.qmd` file (e.g., a “notebook”) is included in a parent `.qmd` file (e.g., a “description page”), and only the child is updated, Quarto will not re-render the parent file—because the parent file itself hasn't changed.

To address this, you can manually update the timestamp of the parent file by using the touch command to mark the parent file as modified:

```bash
touch website_files/description_pages/wildfire.qmd
```

This tricks Quarto into thinking the parent file has changed, so it will be re-rendered.
**Note**: If this workaround doesn't trigger a re-render, open the parent .qmd file, make a small edit (such as adding and removing a space), save the file, and then render the site again. This ensures that Quarto detects the change and processes the parent file properly.
