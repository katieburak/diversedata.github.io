## Instructions to Re-Run Independent Analysis

Any `.qmd` can be opened and ran in RStudio and as long as the used R packages are installed.

However, to run it in a reproducible way, it's recommended to use the provided `renv` environment.

**1. Clone the repository**

Using your shell terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:diverse-data-hub/diverse-data-hub.github.io.git
cd diverse-data-hub.github.io
```

**2. Activate Environment**

See instructions [here](https://github.com/diverse-data-hub/diverse-data-hub.github.io/blob/main/website_files/instructions/how_to_activate_environment.md). 

**3. Open and Interact with Analysis**

All analysis notebooks are stored in `website_files/notebooks/`.

Open the `.qmd` file of interest in RStudio and interact with it as needed.
