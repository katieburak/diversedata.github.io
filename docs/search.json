Identifying the key environmental and human factors linked to these fires can help guide more effective prevention and response strategies.\nSo, our main question is:\nCan we identify the environmental and human factors most associated with large wildfires?\nAccording to Natural Resources Canada, wildfires exceeding 200 hectares in final size are classified as “large fires.” While these fires represent a small percentage of all wildfires, they account for the majority of the total area burned annually.\nThe goal is to explore potential predictors of fire size, such as weather, fire cause, and detection method, and provide insights that could inform early interventions and resource planning.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nLoading Libraries\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(maptiles)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\n\n1.

Logistic Regression Model\nGovernments and emergency planners often care about whether a fire becomes large, not necessarily exactly how large. This makes a binary classification more interpretable and actionable for planning responses. Logistic regression predicts probability of exceeding a threshold, such as “Will this fire exceed 200 hectares?” Modeling the probability of exceeding such a threshold is often more operationally useful than modeling exact hectares.\nIn Decision Making for Wildfires: A Guide for Applying a Risk Management Process at the Incident Level, the authors outline a risk-based decision-making framework. A key concept is identifying risk thresholds to guide decisions. This aligns with the broader goals of wildfire risk management, which emphasize anticipating fire severity and planning appropriate responses. Logistic regression is well-suited to this context because it models the probability of crossing such thresholds, such as a fire becoming large, enabling a clear, interpretable basis for making timely, risk-informed decisions.\nWe built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a fire becoming large based on a set of environmental and operational factors that are consistently measurable, statistically significant, and operationally relevant.\nIn our logistic regression model, we selected key environmental and contextual variables from the wildfire_clean dataset that are well-established drivers of wildfire behavior. These include:\n\ntemperature: Higher temperatures increase evaporation, dry out vegetation, and promote ignition and fire spread.\nwind_speed: Strong winds feed oxygen to the fire and can carry embers over long distances, accelerating spread.\nrelative_humidity: Low humidity conditions dry fuels, increasing the probability and intensity of fire ignition.\nfire_spread_rate: Reflects how quickly a fire expands; a dynamic indicator of fire behavior.\nfire_type: Indicates how the fire behaves (e.g., surface vs. crown fire), which affects controllability and risk.\nfuel_type: Different vegetation types burn at different intensities and rates; fuels like grass or timber respond differently under the same conditions.\nia_access: Stands for Initial Attack Access. Limited access can delay suppression efforts, allowing fires to grow larger.\n\nThese variables were chosen because they each represent core determinants of ignition likelihood, fire intensity, and suppression difficulty. As explained in Introduction to Wildland Fire by Pyne, Andrews, and Laven, this theoretical foundation supports our inclusion of both meteorological and environmental variables in the model.\nMathematical Definition of the Logistic Regression Model\nWe aim to estimate the probability that a wildfire becomes large (i.e., burns more than 200 hectares), using logistic regression.\nLet:\n\\[\nY_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if fire } i \\text{ is large (area &gt; 200 ha)} \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_i =\n\\left(\n\\text{temperature}_i,\n\\text{wind\\_speed}_i,\n\\text{relative\\_humidity}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_type}_i,\n\\text{fuel\\_type}_i,\n\\text{ia\\_access}_i\n\\right)\n\\]\nThen the model is defined as:\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta_i)}\n\\]\nwhere the linear predictor is:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0\n+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{temperature}_i\n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{wind\\_speed}_i\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{relative\\_humidity}_i\n+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i\n+ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}}\n\\]\nHere:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_0 & \\text{ is the intercept} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of coefficients for the categorical predictors} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of dummy variables representing those categorical predictors}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nmodel &lt;- glm(\n  large_fire ~ temperature + wind_speed + relative_humidity +\n    fire_spread_rate + fire_type + fuel_type + ia_access,\n  data = wildfire_clean,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\ntidy_model &lt;- tidy(model) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    estimate = round(estimate, 3),\n    std.error = round(std.error, 3),\n    statistic = round(statistic, 2),\n    p.value = round(p.value, 4)\n  )\n\nkable(tidy_model\n      , caption = \"Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\") |&gt;\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2.016\n0.401\n-5.03\n0.0000\n\n\ntemperature\n0.048\n0.010\n4.66\n0.0000\n\n\nwind_speed\n0.050\n0.004\n11.03\n0.0000\n\n\nrelative_humidity\n-0.031\n0.004\n-7.64\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_spread_rate\n0.104\n0.010\n10.30\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeGround\n-1.354\n0.184\n-7.37\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeSurface\n-1.093\n0.129\n-8.48\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeUnknown\n-13.012\n3683.753\n0.00\n0.9972\n\n\nfuel_typeC2\n-0.945\n0.175\n-5.40\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeC3\n-1.024\n0.276\n-3.71\n0.0002\n\n\nfuel_typeC4\n0.454\n0.337\n1.35\n0.1775\n\n\nfuel_typeC6\n-16.192\n4492.954\n0.00\n0.9971\n\n\nfuel_typeC7\n-16.211\n1258.218\n-0.01\n0.9897\n\n\nfuel_typeD1\n-16.322\n274.554\n-0.06\n0.9526\n\n\nfuel_typeM1\n-1.798\n0.362\n-4.97\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM2\n-2.272\n0.279\n-8.13\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM3\n-15.610\n3734.948\n0.00\n0.9967\n\n\nfuel_typeM4\n-15.179\n6522.639\n0.00\n0.9981\n\n\nfuel_typeO1a\n-2.912\n0.289\n-10.08\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeO1b\n-3.514\n0.456\n-7.70\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS1\n-2.189\n0.486\n-4.51\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS2\n-2.242\n0.546\n-4.11\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeUnknown\n-4.148\n0.481\n-8.62\n0.0000\n\n\nia_accessGround\n-0.861\n0.410\n-2.10\n0.0356\n\n\nia_accessHover Exit\n-0.083\n0.412\n-0.20\n0.8407\n\n\nia_accessRappel\n-14.797\n554.243\n-0.03\n0.9787\n\n\nia_accessUnknown\n0.428\n0.107\n3.99\n0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher wind speed (0.050, p &lt; 0.001), temperature (0.048, p &lt; 0.001), and fire spread rate (0.104, p &lt; 0.001) significantly increase the odds of a large wildfire, while relative humidity (-0.031, p &lt; 0.001) decreases it. Compared to crown fires, ground fires (-1.354, p &lt; 0.001) and surface fires (-1.093, p &lt; 0.001) are much less likely to result in large fires.\nThis logistic regression model estimates the factors influencing the likelihood of a large wildfire. Higher temperature, wind speed, and fire spread rate significantly increase the odds of a large fire, while higher relative humidity decreases it. Certain fire types (e.g., Ground, Surface) and fuel types (e.g., M1, M2, O1a, O1b) are associated with significantly lower odds compared to their respective reference categories. The model shows that higher wind speed, lower humidity, and faster fire spread significantly increase the risk of large wildfires.\nLet’s dig into our model further by examining how different environmental and operational factors interact to influence fire outcomes.\n\n\n4. Interpretation of our Model using marginaleffects\nThe Role of Wind Across Fire Causes\nAs you’ve likely noticed, we did not include true_cause as a predictor in our logistic regression model because it contains many categories, some of which have very few observations. This can lead to large standard errors, unstable coefficient estimates, and a higher risk of overfitting.\nHowever, true_cause remains an important variable for exploratory analysis. Certain ignition causes may be more sensitive to wind. For example, sparks from power lines can spread quickly in high winds, embers from debris burning can travel farther, and unattended fires can escalate rapidly under windy conditions. We chose wind speed for this analysis because it is a well-documented environmental amplifier of fire behavior particularly when interacting with certain ignition causes.\nGiven these interactions, it’s valuable to visualize and investigate how the effect of wind speed on large wild fire development varies across different causes. Let’s explore this further through faceted marginal effect plots.\nThis plot shows how wind speed affects the probability of a large wildfire, and how that effect varies across different true causes of fire.\n\nThe x-axis shows the different values of true_cause (fire ignition source categories).\nThe y-axis shows the marginal effect of wind speed on the predicted probability (i.e., on the response scale) of a fire becoming large.\n\nThe plot helps us compare the sensitivity of different fire causes to wind speed. For example, if one cause shows a higher marginal effect, it means that increasing wind speed has a stronger impact on the likelihood of large fires for that cause.\n\np &lt;- plot_comparisons(\n  model,\n  variables = \"wind_speed\",\n  by = \"true_cause\",\n  type = \"response\"\n)\n\np +\n  scale_color_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect of Wind Speed on Large Fire Probability by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Marginal Effect of Wind Speed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal effects analysis suggests that wind speed may have a relatively stronger impact on the probability of a fire becoming large when the ignition cause is related to Unknown, Insufficient Buffer, Incendiary Device, Hot Exhaust, or Line Impact. However, the overall changes in predicted probabilities are quite small, and the error bars across causes show substantial overlap. This indicates a high degree of uncertainty and suggests that these differences should be interpreted with caution. While the findings may not yet be strong enough to inform operational decisions, they do highlight areas for further exploration. In particular, when wind is forecasted in regions with a history of certain ignition causes, fire managers could use this exploratory insight to guide risk monitoring strategies, while recognizing that more robust evidence is needed before drawing firm conclusions.\nInteraction Effects via Marginal Effects\nWe can also use marginal effects to explore interactions without explicitly adding them to the model, by conditioning on another variable.\nThis plot shows the marginal effect of relative_humidity on the predicted probability of large fire, calculated separately for each level of fire_type, based on your fitted model.\n\nplot_comparisons(model, variables = \"relative_humidity\", by = \"fire_type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the marginal effect of relative humidity across fire types, we found that three fire types showed almost no change in large fire probability as humidity increased. However, one fire type exhibited a noticeably stronger negative effect. This suggests that humidity plays a more meaningful role in suppressing fire growth for certain fire types likely those that are more sensitive to moisture availability, such as crown fires—while having minimal effect on others.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis aimed to uncover the key environmental and operational factors associated with the development of large wildfires in Alberta. Using logistic regression and marginal effects, we modeled the probability of a wildfire exceeding 200 hectares, which is a meaningful operational threshold for fire managers.\nWe found that higher temperature, stronger wind speed, and faster spread rates significantly increase the likelihood of a large wildfire. Conversely, higher relative humidity consistently reduced fire size probability, highlighting its protective role in fire suppression.\nIn addition to main effects, we explored interaction patterns using marginal effects. While we did not include true_cause directly in the model due to its high cardinality and sparse categories, we used it in conjunction with wind_speed to explore how ignition causes might modulate wind’s influence on fire growth. The marginal effect plots suggest that certain causes—such as incendiary devices, line impacts, or insufficient buffer zones are more sensitive to wind speed, potentially due to the nature of how these fires spread under wind-driven conditions.\nSimilarly, by plotting the effect of relative_humidity across different fire_type categories, we observed that humidity suppresses large fire development more strongly in certain fire types, particularly crown fires. This implies that moisture-based mitigation strategies may be more effective in forests prone to crown fire behavior, while having less impact on surface or ground fires.\nWhile some observed differences in marginal effects were small in magnitude and had overlapping confidence intervals, these nuanced insights still provide value. They highlight where future research or localized fire management protocols could focus, especially under climate scenarios with increasing temperature and wind extremes.\nOverall, this case study illustrates how statistical modeling paired with domain-informed exploratory tools like marginal effects can support risk-informed, data-driven wildfire management."

Exploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables to see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\nFirst, we will create a function that will be used for visualization.\n\nhistogram_plot &lt;- function(data, y_var, facet, plot_title = \"Counts by Category\") {\n\n  data_long &lt;- data |&gt; \n    dplyr::select(all_of(c(y_var, facet))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = all_of(y_var), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n    count(var, value, facet_value = .data[[facet]])\n\n  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = n, y = reorder(value, n), fill = facet_value)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n      title = plot_title,\n      x = \"Count\",\n      y = NULL,\n      fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n}\n\n\nhist_sex_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"sex_frequency\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Sex Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_flirt_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"flirts_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Flirting Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_fight_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"fights_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Fighting Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_inc_change_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"inc_change_during_pandemic\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Income Change During the Pandemic Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_sub_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_sub_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_cov_approach_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"agree_covid_approach\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Couple's Agreement on Pandemic Approach Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_quality_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"relationship_quality\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Relationship Quality Frequency\"\n)\n\nplot_grid(\n  hist_sex_freq, \n  hist_flirt_freq, \n  hist_fight_freq, \n  hist_inc_change_freq,\n  hist_sub_covid_freq,\n  hist_par_covid_freq,\n  hist_sub_vax_freq,\n  hist_par_vax_freq,\n  hist_cov_approach_freq,\n  hist_quality_freq,\n  ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is significantly smaller that that of different-sex couples..\nSame-sex and different-sex couples show similar patters in how frequently they engage in sexual activity. However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency. We can also visualize how often couples flirt with or fight with their partners. The data indicates a skew towards lower frequencies for both flirting and fighting.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be noted that most subjects had no change in income during the pandemic, did not have COVID, were fully vaccinated including the booster shot, and completely agreed with their partners in terms of their approach to the pandemic.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Model Fitting and Assumptions\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates. We will also focus only on statistically significant estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables, as well as COVID-19 related variables, affect the perception of relationship quality. Additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same sex couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + \n    sex_frequency + \n    flirts_with_partner + \n    fights_with_partner + \n    inc_change_during_pandemic + \n    subject_had_covid + \n    partner_had_covid + \n    subject_vaccinated + \n    partner_vaccinated + \n    agree_covid_approach,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption. To do so, we can use the Brant-Wald test, which assesses whether our model fulfills this assumption.\n\nbt &lt;- brant(ordinal_model)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nWarning in brant(ordinal_model): 3071083 combinations in table(dv,ivs) do not\noccur.

These are caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations. These gaps may affect Brant statistics. A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables. For now, we will only acknowledge this issue.\n\n\n5. Model Interpretation\nFirst, we will calculate the P-value (as polr()does not calculate it) and we are going to exponentiate the estimates for easier interpretation of the log-odds.\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- cbind(tidy(ordinal_model),\n  p.value = pnorm(abs(tidy(ordinal_model)$statistic), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- summary_partial_ordinal_model |&gt;\n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt; 0.05, \n         coef.type == \"coefficient\")\n\nkable(summary_partial_ordinal_model, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ncoef.type\np.value\nexp_estimate\n\n\n\n\nsame_sex_coupleYes\n-0.53\n0.22\n-2.41\ncoefficient\n0.02\n0.59\n\n\nsex_frequencyTwo or Three Times a Month-Once a Month or Less\n0.64\n0.15\n4.18\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.90\n\n\nflirts_with_partnerEvery Day-A Few Times a Week\n0.89\n0.28\n3.16\ncoefficient\n0.00\n2.44\n\n\nfights_with_partnerOne Time-Zero Times\n-0.65\n0.14\n-4.55\ncoefficient\n0.00\n0.52\n\n\ninc_change_during_pandemicNo Change-Worse\n0.53\n0.17\n3.18\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.70\n\n\npartner_vaccinatedPartially Vaccinated-Not Vaccinated\n0.87\n0.30\n2.88\ncoefficient\n0.00\n2.39\n\n\nagree_covid_approachMostly Agree-Mostly Disagree\n1.20\n0.40\n3.02\ncoefficient\n0.00\n3.32\n\n\nagree_covid_approachCompletely Agree-Mostly Agree\n0.58\n0.13\n4.43\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.79\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive estimates are associated with higher relationship quality, while negative estimates are associated with lower relationship quality. Additionally, the exponential of the estimate is the odds ratio, which represents how much the odds of having a higher relationship_quality level changes between levels.\nWe can interpret these estimates:\n\nsame_sex_couple: Being in a same-sex couple is associated with 41% lower odds of reporting better relationship quality compared to different-sex couples.\nsex_frequency: People who have sex 2-3 times a month have 1.9 higher odds of reporting better relationship quality that those who have sex once a month or less.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting every day vs a few times per week is associated with 2.4 higher odds of better relationship quality.\nfights_with_partner: Fighting once vs none is associated with 48% lower odds of better relationship quality.\ninc_change_during_pandemic: Individuals whose income did not change during the pandemic had 1.7 times higher odds of reporting better relationship quality vs those whose income was worse.\npartner_vaccinated: Having a partner who is partially vaccinated is associated with 2.4 times higher odds of having a better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Mostly agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly disagreeing is associated with 3.3 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Completely agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly agreeing is associated with 1.8 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\n\n\n\n6. Prediction\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on behavioral and COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject. Focusing on the levels that were associated with statistically significant factors:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"Yes\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Once a Month or Less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"A Few Times a Week\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"One Time\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"Worse\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Disagree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.08      0.32      0.41      0.17      0.02 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"No\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Two or Three Times a Month\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"Every Day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"Zero Times\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"No Change\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Partially Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Agree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.02      0.20      0.78 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a same-sex couple, who has sex once a month or less, flirts with their partner a few times a week, fought with their partner once in the last week, experienced worsened income during the pandemic, is not vaccinated (nor is their partner), and mostly disagrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 41% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair and a combined probability of 40% of categorizing it as poor or very poor.\nOn the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex two or three times a month, flirts with their partner on a daily basis, has not fought with their partner in the last week, experienced no change in income during the pandemic, has a partially vaccinated partner, and mostly agrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 78% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent, and a 98% probability of rating it as good or excellent.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how relationship habits, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to perceived relationship quality across different types of couples. Through the analysis, results highlight that relationship behaviors and shared beliefs meaningfully affect how individuals evaluate their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively.\nShared beliefs are beneficial: Agreement with a partner’s approach to COVID-19 was a very strong predictor of relationship quality. Moving in a direction of agreement had a significant positive association.\nExternal factors play a role as well: Financial stability during the pandemic, as well as the partner’s vaccination status were also linked to better relationship quality, suggesting that alignment on external factors, such as health and financial concerns, could cause stress in couple dynamics contribute to positive perceptions.\nSame-sex couples appear to have lower quality in their relationships: Contrary to expectations, being in a same-sex couple was significantly associated with lower perceived relationship quality. While the effect was not as strong as other factors, it was still significant and may warrant further exploration into factors contributing to this difference.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models. Also, encoding categorical predictors must be done with care to ensure meaningful and interpretable contrasts.\nSparsity may affect results: When categorical variables have many levels, certain combinations of predictors may be underrepresented. This sparsity may impact the model, so caution is advised when drawing conclusions from underpopulated subgroups."

Identifying the key environmental and human factors linked to these fires can help guide more effective prevention and response strategies.\nSo, our main question is:\nCan we identify the environmental and human factors most associated with large wildfires?\nAccording to Natural Resources Canada, wildfires exceeding 200 hectares in final size are classified as “large fires.” While these fires represent a small percentage of all wildfires, they account for the majority of the total area burned annually.\nThe goal is to explore potential predictors of fire size, such as weather, fire cause, and detection method, and provide insights that could inform early interventions and resource planning.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nLoading Libraries\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(maptiles)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\n\n1.

Logistic Regression Model\nGovernments and emergency planners often care about whether a fire becomes large, not necessarily exactly how large. This makes a binary classification more interpretable and actionable for planning responses. Logistic regression predicts probability of exceeding a threshold, such as “Will this fire exceed 200 hectares?” Modeling the probability of exceeding such a threshold is often more operationally useful than modeling exact hectares.\nIn Decision Making for Wildfires: A Guide for Applying a Risk Management Process at the Incident Level, the authors outline a risk-based decision-making framework. A key concept is identifying risk thresholds to guide decisions. This aligns with the broader goals of wildfire risk management, which emphasize anticipating fire severity and planning appropriate responses. Logistic regression is well-suited to this context because it models the probability of crossing such thresholds, such as a fire becoming large, enabling a clear, interpretable basis for making timely, risk-informed decisions.\nWe built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a fire becoming large based on a set of environmental and operational factors that are consistently measurable, statistically significant, and operationally relevant.\nIn our logistic regression model, we selected key environmental and contextual variables from the wildfire_clean dataset that are well-established drivers of wildfire behavior. These include:\n\ntemperature: Higher temperatures increase evaporation, dry out vegetation, and promote ignition and fire spread.\nwind_speed: Strong winds feed oxygen to the fire and can carry embers over long distances, accelerating spread.\nrelative_humidity: Low humidity conditions dry fuels, increasing the probability and intensity of fire ignition.\nfire_spread_rate: Reflects how quickly a fire expands; a dynamic indicator of fire behavior.\nfire_type: Indicates how the fire behaves (e.g., surface vs. crown fire), which affects controllability and risk.\nfuel_type: Different vegetation types burn at different intensities and rates; fuels like grass or timber respond differently under the same conditions.\nia_access: Stands for Initial Attack Access. Limited access can delay suppression efforts, allowing fires to grow larger.\n\nThese variables were chosen because they each represent core determinants of ignition likelihood, fire intensity, and suppression difficulty. As explained in Introduction to Wildland Fire by Pyne, Andrews, and Laven, this theoretical foundation supports our inclusion of both meteorological and environmental variables in the model.\nMathematical Definition of the Logistic Regression Model\nWe aim to estimate the probability that a wildfire becomes large (i.e., burns more than 200 hectares), using logistic regression.\nLet:\n\\[\nY_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if fire } i \\text{ is large (area &gt; 200 ha)} \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_i =\n\\left(\n\\text{temperature}_i,\n\\text{wind\\_speed}_i,\n\\text{relative\\_humidity}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_type}_i,\n\\text{fuel\\_type}_i,\n\\text{ia\\_access}_i\n\\right)\n\\]\nThen the model is defined as:\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta_i)}\n\\]\nwhere the linear predictor is:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0\n+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{temperature}_i\n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{wind\\_speed}_i\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{relative\\_humidity}_i\n+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i\n+ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}}\n\\]\nHere:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_0 & \\text{ is the intercept} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of coefficients for the categorical predictors} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of dummy variables representing those categorical predictors}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nmodel &lt;- glm(\n  large_fire ~ temperature + wind_speed + relative_humidity +\n    fire_spread_rate + fire_type + fuel_type + ia_access,\n  data = wildfire_clean,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\ntidy_model &lt;- tidy(model) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    estimate = round(estimate, 3),\n    std.error = round(std.error, 3),\n    statistic = round(statistic, 2),\n    p.value = round(p.value, 4)\n  )\n\nkable(tidy_model\n      , caption = \"Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\") |&gt;\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2.016\n0.401\n-5.03\n0.0000\n\n\ntemperature\n0.048\n0.010\n4.66\n0.0000\n\n\nwind_speed\n0.050\n0.004\n11.03\n0.0000\n\n\nrelative_humidity\n-0.031\n0.004\n-7.64\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_spread_rate\n0.104\n0.010\n10.30\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeGround\n-1.354\n0.184\n-7.37\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeSurface\n-1.093\n0.129\n-8.48\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeUnknown\n-13.012\n3683.753\n0.00\n0.9972\n\n\nfuel_typeC2\n-0.945\n0.175\n-5.40\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeC3\n-1.024\n0.276\n-3.71\n0.0002\n\n\nfuel_typeC4\n0.454\n0.337\n1.35\n0.1775\n\n\nfuel_typeC6\n-16.192\n4492.954\n0.00\n0.9971\n\n\nfuel_typeC7\n-16.211\n1258.218\n-0.01\n0.9897\n\n\nfuel_typeD1\n-16.322\n274.554\n-0.06\n0.9526\n\n\nfuel_typeM1\n-1.798\n0.362\n-4.97\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM2\n-2.272\n0.279\n-8.13\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM3\n-15.610\n3734.948\n0.00\n0.9967\n\n\nfuel_typeM4\n-15.179\n6522.639\n0.00\n0.9981\n\n\nfuel_typeO1a\n-2.912\n0.289\n-10.08\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeO1b\n-3.514\n0.456\n-7.70\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS1\n-2.189\n0.486\n-4.51\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS2\n-2.242\n0.546\n-4.11\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeUnknown\n-4.148\n0.481\n-8.62\n0.0000\n\n\nia_accessGround\n-0.861\n0.410\n-2.10\n0.0356\n\n\nia_accessHover Exit\n-0.083\n0.412\n-0.20\n0.8407\n\n\nia_accessRappel\n-14.797\n554.243\n-0.03\n0.9787\n\n\nia_accessUnknown\n0.428\n0.107\n3.99\n0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher wind speed (0.050, p &lt; 0.001), temperature (0.048, p &lt; 0.001), and fire spread rate (0.104, p &lt; 0.001) significantly increase the odds of a large wildfire, while relative humidity (-0.031, p &lt; 0.001) decreases it. Compared to crown fires, ground fires (-1.354, p &lt; 0.001) and surface fires (-1.093, p &lt; 0.001) are much less likely to result in large fires.\nThis logistic regression model estimates the factors influencing the likelihood of a large wildfire. Higher temperature, wind speed, and fire spread rate significantly increase the odds of a large fire, while higher relative humidity decreases it. Certain fire types (e.g., Ground, Surface) and fuel types (e.g., M1, M2, O1a, O1b) are associated with significantly lower odds compared to their respective reference categories. The model shows that higher wind speed, lower humidity, and faster fire spread significantly increase the risk of large wildfires.\nLet’s dig into our model further by examining how different environmental and operational factors interact to influence fire outcomes.\n\n\n4. Interpretation of our Model using marginaleffects\nThe Role of Wind Across Fire Causes\nAs you’ve likely noticed, we did not include true_cause as a predictor in our logistic regression model because it contains many categories, some of which have very few observations. This can lead to large standard errors, unstable coefficient estimates, and a higher risk of overfitting.\nHowever, true_cause remains an important variable for exploratory analysis. Certain ignition causes may be more sensitive to wind. For example, sparks from power lines can spread quickly in high winds, embers from debris burning can travel farther, and unattended fires can escalate rapidly under windy conditions. We chose wind speed for this analysis because it is a well-documented environmental amplifier of fire behavior particularly when interacting with certain ignition causes.\nGiven these interactions, it’s valuable to visualize and investigate how the effect of wind speed on large wild fire development varies across different causes. Let’s explore this further through faceted marginal effect plots.\nThis plot shows how wind speed affects the probability of a large wildfire, and how that effect varies across different true causes of fire.\n\nThe x-axis shows the different values of true_cause (fire ignition source categories).\nThe y-axis shows the marginal effect of wind speed on the predicted probability (i.e., on the response scale) of a fire becoming large.\n\nThe plot helps us compare the sensitivity of different fire causes to wind speed. For example, if one cause shows a higher marginal effect, it means that increasing wind speed has a stronger impact on the likelihood of large fires for that cause.\n\np &lt;- plot_comparisons(\n  model,\n  variables = \"wind_speed\",\n  by = \"true_cause\",\n  type = \"response\"\n)\n\np +\n  scale_color_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect of Wind Speed on Large Fire Probability by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Marginal Effect of Wind Speed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal effects analysis suggests that wind speed may have a relatively stronger impact on the probability of a fire becoming large when the ignition cause is related to Unknown, Insufficient Buffer, Incendiary Device, Hot Exhaust, or Line Impact. However, the overall changes in predicted probabilities are quite small, and the error bars across causes show substantial overlap. This indicates a high degree of uncertainty and suggests that these differences should be interpreted with caution. While the findings may not yet be strong enough to inform operational decisions, they do highlight areas for further exploration. In particular, when wind is forecasted in regions with a history of certain ignition causes, fire managers could use this exploratory insight to guide risk monitoring strategies, while recognizing that more robust evidence is needed before drawing firm conclusions.\nInteraction Effects via Marginal Effects\nWe can also use marginal effects to explore interactions without explicitly adding them to the model, by conditioning on another variable.\nThis plot shows the marginal effect of relative_humidity on the predicted probability of large fire, calculated separately for each level of fire_type, based on your fitted model.\n\nplot_comparisons(model, variables = \"relative_humidity\", by = \"fire_type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the marginal effect of relative humidity across fire types, we found that three fire types showed almost no change in large fire probability as humidity increased. However, one fire type exhibited a noticeably stronger negative effect. This suggests that humidity plays a more meaningful role in suppressing fire growth for certain fire types likely those that are more sensitive to moisture availability, such as crown fires—while having minimal effect on others.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis aimed to uncover the key environmental and operational factors associated with the development of large wildfires in Alberta. Using logistic regression and marginal effects, we modeled the probability of a wildfire exceeding 200 hectares, which is a meaningful operational threshold for fire managers.\nWe found that higher temperature, stronger wind speed, and faster spread rates significantly increase the likelihood of a large wildfire. Conversely, higher relative humidity consistently reduced fire size probability, highlighting its protective role in fire suppression.\nIn addition to main effects, we explored interaction patterns using marginal effects. While we did not include true_cause directly in the model due to its high cardinality and sparse categories, we used it in conjunction with wind_speed to explore how ignition causes might modulate wind’s influence on fire growth. The marginal effect plots suggest that certain causes—such as incendiary devices, line impacts, or insufficient buffer zones are more sensitive to wind speed, potentially due to the nature of how these fires spread under wind-driven conditions.\nSimilarly, by plotting the effect of relative_humidity across different fire_type categories, we observed that humidity suppresses large fire development more strongly in certain fire types, particularly crown fires. This implies that moisture-based mitigation strategies may be more effective in forests prone to crown fire behavior, while having less impact on surface or ground fires.\nWhile some observed differences in marginal effects were small in magnitude and had overlapping confidence intervals, these nuanced insights still provide value. They highlight where future research or localized fire management protocols could focus, especially under climate scenarios with increasing temperature and wind extremes.\nOverall, this case study illustrates how statistical modeling paired with domain-informed exploratory tools like marginal effects can support risk-informed, data-driven wildfire management."

Are these factors different for same sex couples?\nThis case study examines the association between relationship_quality and a variety of behavioral and pandemic-related variables.\nBy examining survey data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify the behavioral factors that most strongly affect the perceived relationship quality. We will focus specifically on finding how sex_frequency, flirts_with_partner and fights_with_partner affect the perception of relationship quality and we are going to evaluate if these factors have a different impact on same sex couples (same_sex_couple).\nWe will also evaluate whether COVID-19 related factors such vaccination status (subject_vaccinated, partner_vaccinated), COVID-19 illness (subject_had_covid, partner_had_covid), income changes during the pandemic (inc_change_during_pandemic), and agreement on pandemic-related approaches (agree_covid_approach) affected couples’ perceived relationship quality.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nFirst, we need to load the libraries that will be used through the exercise.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(brant)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\n1.

Variable Encoding\nWe can note that our categorical response follows a specific order. For this reason, we require a model that suits ordinal responses. Hence, we will be using an Ordinal Logistic regression model framework.\nIn order to do so, we need to make sure that our response variable is encoded as an ordered factor. We will also take this opportunity to encode our explanatory variables as factors (and ordered factors) as needed.\nFirst, we can encode our nomical categorical explanatory variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(same_sex_couple = as_factor(same_sex_couple)|&gt; \n           fct_recode(\"No\" = \"no\", \"Yes\" = \"yes\"))\n\nlevels(hcmst$same_sex_couple)\n\n[1] \"No\"  \"Yes\"\n\n\nThen, we can encode all our ordinal, categorical, explanatory, behavioral variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt;

Exploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables to see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\nFirst, we will create a function that will be used for visualization.\n\nhistogram_plot &lt;- function(data, y_var, facet, plot_title = \"Counts by Category\") {\n\n  data_long &lt;- data |&gt; \n    dplyr::select(all_of(c(y_var, facet))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = all_of(y_var), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n    count(var, value, facet_value = .data[[facet]])\n\n  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = n, y = reorder(value, n), fill = facet_value)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n      title = plot_title,\n      x = \"Count\",\n      y = NULL,\n      fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n}\n\n\nhist_sex_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"sex_frequency\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Sex Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_flirt_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"flirts_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Flirting Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_fight_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"fights_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Fighting Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_inc_change_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"inc_change_during_pandemic\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Income Change During the Pandemic Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_sub_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_sub_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_cov_approach_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"agree_covid_approach\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Couple's Agreement on Pandemic Approach Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_quality_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"relationship_quality\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Relationship Quality Frequency\"\n)\n\nplot_grid(\n  hist_sex_freq, \n  hist_flirt_freq, \n  hist_fight_freq, \n  hist_inc_change_freq,\n  hist_sub_covid_freq,\n  hist_par_covid_freq,\n  hist_sub_vax_freq,\n  hist_par_vax_freq,\n  hist_cov_approach_freq,\n  hist_quality_freq,\n  ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is significantly smaller that that of different-sex couples..\nSame-sex and different-sex couples show similar patters in how frequently they engage in sexual activity. However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency. We can also visualize how often couples flirt with or fight with their partners. The data indicates a skew towards lower frequencies for both flirting and fighting.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be noted that most subjects had no change in income during the pandemic, did not have COVID, were fully vaccinated including the booster shot, and completely agreed with their partners in terms of their approach to the pandemic.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Model Fitting and Assumptions\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates. We will also focus only on statistically significant estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables, as well as COVID-19 related variables, affect the perception of relationship quality. Additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same sex couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + \n    sex_frequency + \n    flirts_with_partner + \n    fights_with_partner + \n    inc_change_during_pandemic + \n    subject_had_covid + \n    partner_had_covid + \n    subject_vaccinated + \n    partner_vaccinated + \n    agree_covid_approach,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption. To do so, we can use the Brant-Wald test, which assesses whether our model fulfills this assumption.\n\nbt &lt;- brant(ordinal_model)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nWarning in brant(ordinal_model): 3071083 combinations in table(dv,ivs) do not\noccur.

These are caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations. These gaps may affect Brant statistics. A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables. For now, we will only acknowledge this issue.\n\n\n5.

Additionally, the exponential of the estimate is the odds ratio, which represents how much the odds of having a higher relationship_quality level changes between levels.\nWe can interpret these estimates:\n\nsame_sex_couple: Being in a same-sex couple is associated with 41% lower odds of reporting better relationship quality compared to different-sex couples.\nsex_frequency: People who have sex 2-3 times a month have 1.9 higher odds of reporting better relationship quality that those who have sex once a month or less.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting every day vs a few times per week is associated with 2.4 higher odds of better relationship quality.\nfights_with_partner: Fighting once vs none is associated with 48% lower odds of better relationship quality.\ninc_change_during_pandemic: Individuals whose income did not change during the pandemic had 1.7 times higher odds of reporting better relationship quality vs those whose income was worse.\npartner_vaccinated: Having a partner who is partially vaccinated is associated with 2.4 times higher odds of having a better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Mostly agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly disagreeing is associated with 3.3 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Completely agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly agreeing is associated with 1.8 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\n\n\n\n6. Prediction\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on behavioral and COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject. Focusing on the levels that were associated with statistically significant factors:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"Yes\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Once a Month or Less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"A Few Times a Week\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"One Time\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"Worse\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Disagree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.08      0.32      0.41      0.17      0.02 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"No\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Two or Three Times a Month\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"Every Day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"Zero Times\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"No Change\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Partially Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Agree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.02      0.20      0.78 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a same-sex couple, who has sex once a month or less, flirts with their partner a few times a week, fought with their partner once in the last week, experienced worsened income during the pandemic, is not vaccinated (nor is their partner), and mostly disagrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 41% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair and a combined probability of 40% of categorizing it as poor or very poor.\nOn the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex two or three times a month, flirts with their partner on a daily basis, has not fought with their partner in the last week, experienced no change in income during the pandemic, has a partially vaccinated partner, and mostly agrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 78% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent, and a 98% probability of rating it as good or excellent.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how relationship habits, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to perceived relationship quality across different types of couples. Through the analysis, results highlight that relationship behaviors and shared beliefs meaningfully affect how individuals evaluate their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively.\nShared beliefs are beneficial: Agreement with a partner’s approach to COVID-19 was a very strong predictor of relationship quality. Moving in a direction of agreement had a significant positive association.\nExternal factors play a role as well: Financial stability during the pandemic, as well as the partner’s vaccination status were also linked to better relationship quality, suggesting that alignment on external factors, such as health and financial concerns, could cause stress in couple dynamics contribute to positive perceptions.\nSame-sex couples appear to have lower quality in their relationships: Contrary to expectations, being in a same-sex couple was significantly associated with lower perceived relationship quality. While the effect was not as strong as other factors, it was still significant and may warrant further exploration into factors contributing to this difference.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models. Also, encoding categorical predictors must be done with care to ensure meaningful and interpretable contrasts.\nSparsity may affect results: When categorical variables have many levels, certain combinations of predictors may be underrepresented. This sparsity may impact the model, so caution is advised when drawing conclusions from underpopulated subgroups."

    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nHow much does a team’s tournament seed predict its success in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament?\nThis analysis explores the relationship between a team’s seed and its results on a tournament to evaluate whether teams with lower seeds consistently outperform ones with higher seeds.\nBy examining historical data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify trends in tournament advancement by seed level\n\nSeeding is intended to reflect a team’s regular-season performance. In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance. But upsets, bracket surprises, and standout performances from lower seeds raise questions like “How reliable is seeding as a predictor of success?”\nUnderstanding these dynamics can inform fan expectations and bracket predictions.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe should load the necessary libraries we will be using.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n1. Data Cleaning & Processing\nFirst, let’s load our data and remove all NA values for our variables of interest seed and tourney_wins.\n\n# Reading Data\nmarchmadness &lt;- read_csv(\"../../data/clean/womensmarchmadness.csv\") \n\n# Review total rows\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n# Removing NA but only in selected columns\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; drop_na(seed, tourney_wins)\n\n# Notice no rows were removed\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n\nNote that, the seed = 0 designation in 1983 notes the eight teams that played an opening-round game to become the No.8 seed in each region. For this exercise, we will not take them into consideration. Since seed is an ordinal categorical variable, we can set it as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(seed != 0)\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe can see which seeds appear more often.\n\nseed_count &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  count(seed) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed))\n\nggplot(\n  seed_count, \n  aes(x = seed, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Seeds\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Number of Teams\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the average tournament wins for each seed:\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_tourney_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_tourney_wins)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = as.factor(seed),\n      y = avg_tourney_wins)\n    ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Avg. Tourney Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can note that a teams with a higher seed tend to win more tournaments! We can also see the total amount of tourney wins for each seed.\n\nseed_order &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_wins)) |&gt; \n  pull(seed)\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed_order)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)\n  ) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Tournament Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Seed Treatment: Numeric vs Factor\nAn important decision on this analysis is whether to use seed as a numeric or an ordered categorical predictor. Treating seed as a numeric explanatory variable assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\nTo test if this assumption is appropriate, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed.

If the variance is much greater, we might need a Negative Binomial model. We can do an dispersion test to evaluate this matter.\nLetting \\(Y_i\\) be the \\(ith\\) Poisson response in the count regression model, in the presence of equidispersion, \\(Y_i\\) has the following parameters:\n\\(E(Y_i)=\\lambda_i, Var(Y_i)=\\lambda_i\\)\nThe test uses the following mathematical expression (using a \\(1+\\gamma\\) dispersion factor):\n\\(Var(Y_i)=(1+\\gamma)*\\lambda_i\\)\nwith the hypotheses:\n\\(H_0:1 + \\gamma = 1\\)\n\\(H_a: 1 + \\gamma &gt; 1\\)\nWhen there is evidence of overdispersion in our data, we will reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nkable(tidy(dispersiontest(poisson_model_factor)), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n0.96\n-0.56\n0.71\nOverdispersion test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the P-value (0.71) is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant evidence of overdispersion in the Poisson model.\n\n\n5. Hypothesis Testing: Are Seed and Wins Associated?\n\nsummary_model &lt;- tidy(poisson_model_factor) |&gt; \n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt;= 0.05)\n  \nkable(summary_model, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nexp_estimate\n\n\n\n\nseed2-1\n-0.34\n0.07\n-4.96\n0.00\n0.71\n\n\nseed3-2\n-0.33\n0.08\n-4.05\n0.00\n0.72\n\n\nseed5-4\n-0.46\n0.10\n-4.34\n0.00\n0.63\n\n\nseed8-7\n-0.34\n0.15\n-2.22\n0.03\n0.71\n\n\nseed12-11\n-0.64\n0.23\n-2.75\n0.01\n0.52\n\n\nseed13-12\n-0.92\n0.38\n-2.40\n0.02\n0.40\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we can see that seed is significantly associated with tourney_wins, particularly in changes in levels between lower seeds. These results can be interpreted as:\n\nSeed 2 teams win 29% (1-0.71) fewer games than seed 1.\nSeed 3 teams win 28% fewer games than seed 2.\nSeed 5 teams win 37% fewer games than seed 4.\nSeed 8 teams win 29% fewer games than seed 7.\nSeed 12 teams win 48% fewer games than seed 11.\nSeed 13 teams win 60% fewer games than seed 12.\n\nThis conclusion is easier to interpret visually, so, let’s plot our Poisson regression model to view the impact of seed on tourney_wins:\n\nmarchmadness$predicted_wins &lt;- predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n\nmodel_plot &lt;- ggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_wins), color = \"skyblue2\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Poisson Regression: Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nmodel_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis examined the relationship between a team’s tournament seed and its performance in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament. The results suggest that:\n\nSeed strongly predicts performance: Lower-numbered seeds (higher-ranked teams) tend to win more games on average. The correlation between seed and wins was statistically significant, with higher seeds associated with fewer wins.\nPoisson regression supports seeding as a predictor: The Poisson regression model confirmed that seed is a significant predictor of tournament wins, particularly for selected levels, as expected for a count variable like wins.\nModel assumptions are key: Treating seed as a numeric variable would have assumed a linear effect across all seed values, which would have oversimplified the relationship with the outcome. Ensuring that explanatory variables are appropriately coded is key. In this case, seed offered improved insight when encoded as an ordered factor.\nThere is a lot of variation around the prediction: While seeding generally reflects team strength, upsets and unexpected performances do occur, showing that other factors also influence tournament outcomes.\n\nSeeding is an important predictor of success, but clearly other factors influence the results. It sets expectations, but unexpected performances still shape March Madness."

In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance. But upsets, bracket surprises, and standout performances from lower seeds raise questions like “How reliable is seeding as a predictor of success?”\nUnderstanding these dynamics can inform fan expectations and bracket predictions.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe should load the necessary libraries we will be using.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n1.

For this exercise, we will not take them into consideration. Since seed is an ordinal categorical variable, we can set it as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(seed != 0)\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe can see which seeds appear more often.\n\nseed_count &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  count(seed) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed))\n\nggplot(\n  seed_count, \n  aes(x = seed, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Seeds\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Number of Teams\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the average tournament wins for each seed:\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_tourney_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_tourney_wins)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = as.factor(seed),\n      y = avg_tourney_wins)\n    ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Avg.

Seed Treatment: Numeric vs Factor\nAn important decision on this analysis is whether to use seed as a numeric or an ordered categorical predictor. Treating seed as a numeric explanatory variable assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\nTo test if this assumption is appropriate, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed. We’ll create models using seed as both a numeric variable and a factor.\nHowever, first, we need to encode seed as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness_factor &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = as.ordered(seed)) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = fct_relevel\n         (seed, \n           c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \n             \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \n             \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \n             \"16\")))\n\nGiven that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness_factor)\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, both models don’t appear to be significantly different from each other.
