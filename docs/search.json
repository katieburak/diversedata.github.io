Discussion\nThe logistic regression model revealed that higher wind speeds are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of a fire becoming large (over 10 hectares), consistent with our expectations about fire spread dynamics.\nSurprisingly, temperature showed a small negative association with fire size, though this may be influenced by interactions with other environmental factors like humidity or fuel type.\nAmong causes, “Insufficient Resources” and “Line Impact” were associated with significantly higher odds of large fires. This suggests that both human-related limitations and infrastructure vulnerability (like power lines) play a role in fire escalation.\nThe detection agent type showed weak evidence that fires detected by UNP agents may be less likely to become large, compared to FPD Staff, but the effect was not statistically strong (p = 0.09). Further exploration is needed here, especially considering the early intervention ability of different detection teams.\nThese findings provide insights into key environmental and operational factors influencing wildfire severity. Importantly, they point to the need for targeted mitigation strategies in areas with poor detection access or high infrastructure risks.\nIn the broader context of equity, this analysis reinforces that resource constraints and delayed detection—often more common in remote or underfunded regions—can amplify wildfire impacts. Data-informed strategies can help ensure more equitable protection against climate-driven disasters.\n\n\n5. Interpretation Boost using marginaleffects\nWind Speed\nAs wind speed increases, the model estimates a higher probability of a fire becoming large (&gt;10 hectares). However, the variability in the predicted probabilities also increases at higher wind speeds, as indicated by the wider confidence intervals. This suggests that while there is a general upward trend, the model’s certainty about the exact magnitude of the effect decreases in this range—likely due to fewer observations or greater variability in fire outcomes at high wind speeds.\n\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\n\nWarning: package 'marginaleffects' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n## continuous variable\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"WIND_SPEED\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nAs temperature increases, the model predicts a relatively stable probability of a fire becoming large. The trend line flattens and the confidence intervals narrow, indicating that the model is more confident and consistent in its estimates across higher temperature ranges. This suggests that the relationship between temperature and fire size is more stable and predictable at higher temperatures, possibly due to a larger number of observations or less variability in outcomes.\n\n## continuous variable \"TEMPERATURE\"\n\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"TEMPERATURE\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Cause\nThe predicted probability of a large fire is near zero for most TRUE_CAUSE categories, indicating that these causes (e.g., natural ignition, campfires, equipment use) are generally not associated with large-scale fires. However, the category “Insufficient Resources” stands out with a significantly higher predicted probability and a wide confidence interval. This suggests that fires classified under this cause are much more likely to become large, though the wide interval reflects substantial uncertainty — likely due to a small number of observations in that category.\n\n## categorical variable \"TRUE_CAUSE\"\nplot_predictions(model, by = \"TRUE_CAUSE\") +\n  ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Probability of Large Fire by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Agent Type\nAlthough fires detected by AIR agents appear more likely to become large, the model is relatively uncertain about this pattern. The wide confidence interval indicates that this result should be interpreted cautiously, and may reflect data sparsity or high variability in fire outcomes for AIR-detected cases.\n\n## categorical variable \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\n)"

Exploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables to see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\nFirst, we will create a function that will be used for visualization.\n\nhistogram_plot &lt;- function(data, y_var, facet, plot_title = \"Counts by Category\") {\n\n  data_long &lt;- data |&gt; \n    dplyr::select(all_of(c(y_var, facet))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = all_of(y_var), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n    count(var, value, facet_value = .data[[facet]])\n\n  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = n, y = reorder(value, n), fill = facet_value)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n      title = plot_title,\n      x = \"Count\",\n      y = NULL,\n      fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n}\n\n\nhist_sex_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"sex_frequency\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Sex Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_flirt_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"flirts_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Flirting Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_fight_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"fights_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Fighting Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_inc_change_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"inc_change_during_pandemic\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Income Change During the Pandemic Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_sub_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_sub_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_cov_approach_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"agree_covid_approach\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Couple's Agreement on Pandemic Approach Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_quality_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"relationship_quality\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Relationship Quality Frequency\"\n)\n\nplot_grid(\n  hist_sex_freq, \n  hist_flirt_freq, \n  hist_fight_freq, \n  hist_inc_change_freq,\n  hist_sub_covid_freq,\n  hist_par_covid_freq,\n  hist_sub_vax_freq,\n  hist_par_vax_freq,\n  hist_cov_approach_freq,\n  hist_quality_freq,\n  ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is significantly smaller that that of different-sex couples..\nSame-sex and different-sex couples show similar patters in how frequently they engage in sexual activity. However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency. We can also visualize how often couples flirt with or fight with their partners. The data indicates a skew towards lower frequencies for both flirting and fighting.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be noted that most subjects had no change in income during the pandemic, did not have COVID, were fully vaccinated including the booster shot, and completely agreed with their partners in terms of their approach to the pandemic.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Model Fitting and Assumptions\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates. We will also focus only on statistically significant estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables, as well as COVID-19 related variables, affect the perception of relationship quality. Additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same sex couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + \n    sex_frequency + \n    flirts_with_partner + \n    fights_with_partner + \n    inc_change_during_pandemic + \n    subject_had_covid + \n    partner_had_covid + \n    subject_vaccinated + \n    partner_vaccinated + \n    agree_covid_approach,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption. To do so, we can use the Brant-Wald test, which assesses whether our model fulfills this assumption.\n\nbt &lt;- brant(ordinal_model)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nWarning in brant(ordinal_model): 3071083 combinations in table(dv,ivs) do not\noccur.

These are caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations. These gaps may affect Brant statistics. A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables. For now, we will only acknowledge this issue.\n\n\n5. Model Interpretation\nFirst, we will calculate the P-value (as polr()does not calculate it) and we are going to exponentiate the estimates for easier interpretation of the log-odds.\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- cbind(tidy(ordinal_model),\n  p.value = pnorm(abs(tidy(ordinal_model)$statistic), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- summary_partial_ordinal_model |&gt;\n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt; 0.05, \n         coef.type == \"coefficient\")\n\nkable(summary_partial_ordinal_model, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ncoef.type\np.value\nexp_estimate\n\n\n\n\nsame_sex_coupleYes\n-0.53\n0.22\n-2.41\ncoefficient\n0.02\n0.59\n\n\nsex_frequencyTwo or Three Times a Month-Once a Month or Less\n0.64\n0.15\n4.18\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.90\n\n\nflirts_with_partnerEvery Day-A Few Times a Week\n0.89\n0.28\n3.16\ncoefficient\n0.00\n2.44\n\n\nfights_with_partnerOne Time-Zero Times\n-0.65\n0.14\n-4.55\ncoefficient\n0.00\n0.52\n\n\ninc_change_during_pandemicNo Change-Worse\n0.53\n0.17\n3.18\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.70\n\n\npartner_vaccinatedPartially Vaccinated-Not Vaccinated\n0.87\n0.30\n2.88\ncoefficient\n0.00\n2.39\n\n\nagree_covid_approachMostly Agree-Mostly Disagree\n1.20\n0.40\n3.02\ncoefficient\n0.00\n3.32\n\n\nagree_covid_approachCompletely Agree-Mostly Agree\n0.58\n0.13\n4.43\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.79\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive estimates are associated with higher relationship quality, while negative estimates are associated with lower relationship quality. Additionally, the exponential of the estimate is the odds ratio, which represents how much the odds of having a higher relationship_quality level changes between levels.\nWe can interpret these estimates:\n\nsame_sex_couple: Being in a same-sex couple is associated with 41% lower odds of reporting better relationship quality compared to different-sex couples.\nsex_frequency: People who have sex 2-3 times a month have 1.9 higher odds of reporting better relationship quality that those who have sex once a month or less.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting every day vs a few times per week is associated with 2.4 higher odds of better relationship quality.\nfights_with_partner: Fighting once vs none is associated with 48% lower odds of better relationship quality.\ninc_change_during_pandemic: Individuals whose income did not change during the pandemic had 1.7 times higher odds of reporting better relationship quality vs those whose income was worse.\npartner_vaccinated: Having a partner who is partially vaccinated is associated with 2.4 times higher odds of having a better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Mostly agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly disagreeing is associated with 3.3 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Completely agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly agreeing is associated with 1.8 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\n\n\n\n6. Prediction\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on behavioral and COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject. Focusing on the levels that were associated with statistically significant factors:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"Yes\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Once a Month or Less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"A Few Times a Week\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"One Time\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"Worse\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Disagree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.08      0.32      0.41      0.17      0.02 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"No\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Two or Three Times a Month\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"Every Day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"Zero Times\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"No Change\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Partially Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Agree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.02      0.20      0.78 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a same-sex couple, who has sex once a month or less, flirts with their partner a few times a week, fought with their partner once in the last week, experienced worsened income during the pandemic, is not vaccinated (nor is their partner), and mostly disagrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 41% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair and a combined probability of 40% of categorizing it as poor or very poor.\nOn the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex two or three times a month, flirts with their partner on a daily basis, has not fought with their partner in the last week, experienced no change in income during the pandemic, has a partially vaccinated partner, and mostly agrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 78% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent, and a 98% probability of rating it as good or excellent.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how relationship habits, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to perceived relationship quality across different types of couples. Through the analysis, results highlight that relationship behaviors and shared beliefs meaningfully affect how individuals evaluate their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively.\nShared beliefs are beneficial: Agreement with a partner’s approach to COVID-19 was a very strong predictor of relationship quality. Moving in a direction of agreement had a significant positive association.\nExternal factors play a role as well: Financial stability during the pandemic, as well as the partner’s vaccination status were also linked to better relationship quality, suggesting that alignment on external factors, such as health and financial concerns, could cause stress in couple dynamics contribute to positive perceptions.\nSame-sex couples appear to have lower quality in their relationships: Contrary to expectations, being in a same-sex couple was significantly associated with lower perceived relationship quality. While the effect was not as strong as other factors, it was still significant and may warrant further exploration into factors contributing to this difference.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models. Also, encoding categorical predictors must be done with care to ensure meaningful and interpretable contrasts.\nSparsity may affect results: When categorical variables have many levels, certain combinations of predictors may be underrepresented. This sparsity may impact the model, so caution is advised when drawing conclusions from underpopulated subgroups."

Discussion\nThe logistic regression model revealed that higher wind speeds are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of a fire becoming large (over 10 hectares), consistent with our expectations about fire spread dynamics.\nSurprisingly, temperature showed a small negative association with fire size, though this may be influenced by interactions with other environmental factors like humidity or fuel type.\nAmong causes, “Insufficient Resources” and “Line Impact” were associated with significantly higher odds of large fires. This suggests that both human-related limitations and infrastructure vulnerability (like power lines) play a role in fire escalation.\nThe detection agent type showed weak evidence that fires detected by UNP agents may be less likely to become large, compared to FPD Staff, but the effect was not statistically strong (p = 0.09). Further exploration is needed here, especially considering the early intervention ability of different detection teams.\nThese findings provide insights into key environmental and operational factors influencing wildfire severity. Importantly, they point to the need for targeted mitigation strategies in areas with poor detection access or high infrastructure risks.\nIn the broader context of equity, this analysis reinforces that resource constraints and delayed detection—often more common in remote or underfunded regions—can amplify wildfire impacts. Data-informed strategies can help ensure more equitable protection against climate-driven disasters.\n\n\n5. Interpretation Boost using marginaleffects\nWind Speed\nAs wind speed increases, the model estimates a higher probability of a fire becoming large (&gt;10 hectares). However, the variability in the predicted probabilities also increases at higher wind speeds, as indicated by the wider confidence intervals. This suggests that while there is a general upward trend, the model’s certainty about the exact magnitude of the effect decreases in this range—likely due to fewer observations or greater variability in fire outcomes at high wind speeds.\n\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\n\nWarning: package 'marginaleffects' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n## continuous variable\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"WIND_SPEED\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nAs temperature increases, the model predicts a relatively stable probability of a fire becoming large. The trend line flattens and the confidence intervals narrow, indicating that the model is more confident and consistent in its estimates across higher temperature ranges. This suggests that the relationship between temperature and fire size is more stable and predictable at higher temperatures, possibly due to a larger number of observations or less variability in outcomes.\n\n## continuous variable \"TEMPERATURE\"\n\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"TEMPERATURE\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Cause\nThe predicted probability of a large fire is near zero for most TRUE_CAUSE categories, indicating that these causes (e.g., natural ignition, campfires, equipment use) are generally not associated with large-scale fires. However, the category “Insufficient Resources” stands out with a significantly higher predicted probability and a wide confidence interval. This suggests that fires classified under this cause are much more likely to become large, though the wide interval reflects substantial uncertainty — likely due to a small number of observations in that category.\n\n## categorical variable \"TRUE_CAUSE\"\nplot_predictions(model, by = \"TRUE_CAUSE\") +\n  ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Probability of Large Fire by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Agent Type\nAlthough fires detected by AIR agents appear more likely to become large, the model is relatively uncertain about this pattern. The wide confidence interval indicates that this result should be interpreted cautiously, and may reflect data sparsity or high variability in fire outcomes for AIR-detected cases.\n\n## categorical variable \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\n)"

We will also take this opportunity to encode our explanatory variables as factors (and ordered factors) as needed.\nFirst, we can encode our nomical categorical explanatory variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(same_sex_couple = as_factor(same_sex_couple)|&gt; \n           fct_recode(\"No\" = \"no\", \"Yes\" = \"yes\"))\n\nlevels(hcmst$same_sex_couple)\n\n[1] \"No\"  \"Yes\"\n\n\nThen, we can encode all our ordinal, categorical, explanatory, behavioral variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = as.ordered(sex_frequency)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    sex_frequency = fct_relevel(\n      sex_frequency, \n      c(\n        \"once_a_month_or_less\", \n        \"2_to_3_times_a_month\", \n        \"once_or_twice_a_week\", \n        \"3_to_6_times_a_week\", \n        \"once_or_more_a_day\"\n        )\n      ) |&gt;

Exploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables to see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\nFirst, we will create a function that will be used for visualization.\n\nhistogram_plot &lt;- function(data, y_var, facet, plot_title = \"Counts by Category\") {\n\n  data_long &lt;- data |&gt; \n    dplyr::select(all_of(c(y_var, facet))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = all_of(y_var), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n    count(var, value, facet_value = .data[[facet]])\n\n  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = n, y = reorder(value, n), fill = facet_value)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n      title = plot_title,\n      x = \"Count\",\n      y = NULL,\n      fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n}\n\n\nhist_sex_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"sex_frequency\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Sex Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_flirt_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"flirts_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Flirting Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_fight_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"fights_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Fighting Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_inc_change_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"inc_change_during_pandemic\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Income Change During the Pandemic Frequency\"\n)\n    \nhist_sub_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner had COVID-19 Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_sub_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"subject_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_par_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"partner_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Subject's Partner Vaccination Status Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_cov_approach_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"agree_covid_approach\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Couple's Agreement on Pandemic Approach Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_quality_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"relationship_quality\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Relationship Quality Frequency\"\n)\n\nplot_grid(\n  hist_sex_freq, \n  hist_flirt_freq, \n  hist_fight_freq, \n  hist_inc_change_freq,\n  hist_sub_covid_freq,\n  hist_par_covid_freq,\n  hist_sub_vax_freq,\n  hist_par_vax_freq,\n  hist_cov_approach_freq,\n  hist_quality_freq,\n  ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is significantly smaller that that of different-sex couples..\nSame-sex and different-sex couples show similar patters in how frequently they engage in sexual activity. However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency. We can also visualize how often couples flirt with or fight with their partners. The data indicates a skew towards lower frequencies for both flirting and fighting.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be noted that most subjects had no change in income during the pandemic, did not have COVID, were fully vaccinated including the booster shot, and completely agreed with their partners in terms of their approach to the pandemic.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Model Fitting and Assumptions\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates. We will also focus only on statistically significant estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables, as well as COVID-19 related variables, affect the perception of relationship quality. Additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same sex couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + \n    sex_frequency + \n    flirts_with_partner + \n    fights_with_partner + \n    inc_change_during_pandemic + \n    subject_had_covid + \n    partner_had_covid + \n    subject_vaccinated + \n    partner_vaccinated + \n    agree_covid_approach,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption. To do so, we can use the Brant-Wald test, which assesses whether our model fulfills this assumption.\n\nbt &lt;- brant(ordinal_model)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nWarning in brant(ordinal_model): 3071083 combinations in table(dv,ivs) do not\noccur.

These are caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations. These gaps may affect Brant statistics. A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables. For now, we will only acknowledge this issue.\n\n\n5. Model Interpretation\nFirst, we will calculate the P-value (as polr()does not calculate it) and we are going to exponentiate the estimates for easier interpretation of the log-odds.\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- cbind(tidy(ordinal_model),\n  p.value = pnorm(abs(tidy(ordinal_model)$statistic), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- summary_partial_ordinal_model |&gt;\n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt; 0.05, \n         coef.type == \"coefficient\")\n\nkable(summary_partial_ordinal_model, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\ncoef.type\np.value\nexp_estimate\n\n\n\n\nsame_sex_coupleYes\n-0.53\n0.22\n-2.41\ncoefficient\n0.02\n0.59\n\n\nsex_frequencyTwo or Three Times a Month-Once a Month or Less\n0.64\n0.15\n4.18\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.90\n\n\nflirts_with_partnerEvery Day-A Few Times a Week\n0.89\n0.28\n3.16\ncoefficient\n0.00\n2.44\n\n\nfights_with_partnerOne Time-Zero Times\n-0.65\n0.14\n-4.55\ncoefficient\n0.00\n0.52\n\n\ninc_change_during_pandemicNo Change-Worse\n0.53\n0.17\n3.18\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.70\n\n\npartner_vaccinatedPartially Vaccinated-Not Vaccinated\n0.87\n0.30\n2.88\ncoefficient\n0.00\n2.39\n\n\nagree_covid_approachMostly Agree-Mostly Disagree\n1.20\n0.40\n3.02\ncoefficient\n0.00\n3.32\n\n\nagree_covid_approachCompletely Agree-Mostly Agree\n0.58\n0.13\n4.43\ncoefficient\n0.00\n1.79\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive estimates are associated with higher relationship quality, while negative estimates are associated with lower relationship quality. Additionally, the exponential of the estimate is the odds ratio, which represents how much the odds of having a higher relationship_quality level changes between levels.\nWe can interpret these estimates:\n\nsame_sex_couple: Being in a same-sex couple is associated with 41% lower odds of reporting better relationship quality compared to different-sex couples.\nsex_frequency: People who have sex 2-3 times a month have 1.9 higher odds of reporting better relationship quality that those who have sex once a month or less.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting every day vs a few times per week is associated with 2.4 higher odds of better relationship quality.\nfights_with_partner: Fighting once vs none is associated with 48% lower odds of better relationship quality.\ninc_change_during_pandemic: Individuals whose income did not change during the pandemic had 1.7 times higher odds of reporting better relationship quality vs those whose income was worse.\npartner_vaccinated: Having a partner who is partially vaccinated is associated with 2.4 times higher odds of having a better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Mostly agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly disagreeing is associated with 3.3 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\nagree_covid_approach: Completely agreeing with a partner’s approach to COVID vs mostly agreeing is associated with 1.8 times higher odds of better relationship quality.\n\n\n\n6. Prediction\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on behavioral and COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject. Focusing on the levels that were associated with statistically significant factors:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"Yes\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Once a Month or Less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"A Few Times a Week\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"One Time\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"Worse\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Disagree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.08      0.32      0.41      0.17      0.02 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"No\",\n  sex_frequency = \"Two or Three Times a Month\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"Every Day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"Zero Times\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"No Change\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"No\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"No\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"Not Vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"Partially Vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"Mostly Agree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nVery Poor      Poor      Fair      Good Excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.02      0.20      0.78 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a same-sex couple, who has sex once a month or less, flirts with their partner a few times a week, fought with their partner once in the last week, experienced worsened income during the pandemic, is not vaccinated (nor is their partner), and mostly disagrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 41% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair and a combined probability of 40% of categorizing it as poor or very poor.\nOn the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex two or three times a month, flirts with their partner on a daily basis, has not fought with their partner in the last week, experienced no change in income during the pandemic, has a partially vaccinated partner, and mostly agrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 78% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent, and a 98% probability of rating it as good or excellent.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how relationship habits, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to perceived relationship quality across different types of couples. Through the analysis, results highlight that relationship behaviors and shared beliefs meaningfully affect how individuals evaluate their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively.\nShared beliefs are beneficial: Agreement with a partner’s approach to COVID-19 was a very strong predictor of relationship quality. Moving in a direction of agreement had a significant positive association.\nExternal factors play a role as well: Financial stability during the pandemic, as well as the partner’s vaccination status were also linked to better relationship quality, suggesting that alignment on external factors, such as health and financial concerns, could cause stress in couple dynamics contribute to positive perceptions.\nSame-sex couples appear to have lower quality in their relationships: Contrary to expectations, being in a same-sex couple was significantly associated with lower perceived relationship quality. While the effect was not as strong as other factors, it was still significant and may warrant further exploration into factors contributing to this difference.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models. Also, encoding categorical predictors must be done with care to ensure meaningful and interpretable contrasts.\nSparsity may affect results: When categorical variables have many levels, certain combinations of predictors may be underrepresented. This sparsity may impact the model, so caution is advised when drawing conclusions from underpopulated subgroups."

    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nHow much does a team’s tournament seed predict its success in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament?\nThis analysis explores the relationship between a team’s seed and its results on a tournament to evaluate whether teams with lower seeds consistently outperform ones with higher seeds.\nBy examining historical data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify trends in tournament advancement by seed level\n\nSeeding is intended to reflect a team’s regular-season performance. In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance. But upsets, bracket surprises, and standout performances from lower seeds raise questions like “How reliable is seeding as a predictor of success?”\nUnderstanding these dynamics can inform fan expectations and bracket predictions.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe should load the necessary libraries we will be using.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n1. Data Cleaning & Processing\nFirst, let’s load our data and remove all NA values for our variables of interest seed and tourney_wins.\n\n# Reading Data\nmarchmadness &lt;- read_csv(\"../../data/clean/womensmarchmadness.csv\") \n\n# Review total rows\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n# Removing NA but only in selected columns\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; drop_na(seed, tourney_wins)\n\n# Notice no rows were removed\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n\nNote that, the seed = 0 designation in 1983 notes the eight teams that played an opening-round game to become the No.8 seed in each region. For this exercise, we will not take them into consideration. Since seed is an ordinal categorical variable, we can set it as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(seed != 0)\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe can see which seeds appear more often.\n\nseed_count &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  count(seed) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed))\n\nggplot(\n  seed_count, \n  aes(x = seed, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Seeds\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Number of Teams\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the average tournament wins for each seed:\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_tourney_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_tourney_wins)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = as.factor(seed),\n      y = avg_tourney_wins)\n    ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Avg. Tourney Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can note that a teams with a higher seed tend to win more tournaments! We can also see the total amount of tourney wins for each seed.\n\nseed_order &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_wins)) |&gt; \n  pull(seed)\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed_order)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)\n  ) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Tournament Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Seed Treatment: Numeric vs Factor\nAn important decision on this analysis is whether to use seed as a numeric or an ordered categorical predictor. Treating seed as a numeric explanatory variable assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\nTo test if this assumption is appropriate, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed. We’ll create models using seed as both a numeric variable and a factor.\nHowever, first, we need to encode seed as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness_factor &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = as.ordered(seed)) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = fct_relevel\n         (seed, \n           c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \n             \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \n             \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \n             \"16\")))\n\nGiven that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness_factor)\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, both models don’t appear to be significantly different from each other. Now, if we wanted to formally evaluate which is the better approach we could use likelihood-based model selection tools.\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2117.42\n4238.84\n4250.12\n1610.34\n2082\n2084\n\n\n\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2079.52\n4191.04\n4281.31\n1534.54\n2068\n2084\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on lower residual deviance, higher log-likelihood, and a lower AIC, the model that treats seed as a factor fits the data better. This would suggest that the relationship between tournament seed and number of wins is not linear, and would support using an approach that does not assume a constant effect per unit change in seed.\nHowever, before deciding on using a more complex model, we can evaluate if this complexity offers a significantly better modeling approach. To do this, we can perform a likelihood ratio test.\n\\(H_0\\): Model poisson_model fits the data better than model poisson_model_factor\n\\(H_a\\): Model poisson_model_factor fits the data better than model poisson_model\n\nanova_result &lt;- tidy(anova(poisson_model, poisson_model_factor, test = \"Chisq\"))\n\nkable(anova_result, digits = 2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf.residual\nresidual.deviance\ndf\ndeviance\np.value\n\n\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2082\n1610.34\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2068\n1534.54\n14\n75.79\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results indicate strong evidence that the model with seed treated as a factor fits the data significantly better than treating it as a numeric predictor. Therefore, we will proceed by using seed as a factor.\n\n\n4. Overdispersion Testing\nIt is noteworthy that Poisson assumes that the mean is equal to the variance of the count variable.

    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nHow much does a team’s tournament seed predict its success in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament?\nThis analysis explores the relationship between a team’s seed and its results on a tournament to evaluate whether teams with lower seeds consistently outperform ones with higher seeds.\nBy examining historical data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify trends in tournament advancement by seed level\n\nSeeding is intended to reflect a team’s regular-season performance. In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance. But upsets, bracket surprises, and standout performances from lower seeds raise questions like “How reliable is seeding as a predictor of success?”\nUnderstanding these dynamics can inform fan expectations and bracket predictions.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe should load the necessary libraries we will be using.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n1. Data Cleaning & Processing\nFirst, let’s load our data and remove all NA values for our variables of interest seed and tourney_wins.\n\n# Reading Data\nmarchmadness &lt;- read_csv(\"../../data/clean/womensmarchmadness.csv\") \n\n# Review total rows\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n# Removing NA but only in selected columns\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; drop_na(seed, tourney_wins)\n\n# Notice no rows were removed\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n\nNote that, the seed = 0 designation in 1983 notes the eight teams that played an opening-round game to become the No.8 seed in each region. For this exercise, we will not take them into consideration. Since seed is an ordinal categorical variable, we can set it as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(seed != 0)\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe can see which seeds appear more often.\n\nseed_count &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  count(seed) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed))\n\nggplot(\n  seed_count, \n  aes(x = seed, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Seeds\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Number of Teams\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the average tournament wins for each seed:\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_tourney_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_tourney_wins)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = as.factor(seed),\n      y = avg_tourney_wins)\n    ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Avg. Tourney Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can note that a teams with a higher seed tend to win more tournaments! We can also see the total amount of tourney wins for each seed.\n\nseed_order &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_wins)) |&gt; \n  pull(seed)\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed_order)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)\n  ) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Tournament Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Seed Treatment: Numeric vs Factor\nAn important decision on this analysis is whether to use seed as a numeric or an ordered categorical predictor. Treating seed as a numeric explanatory variable assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\nTo test if this assumption is appropriate, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed. We’ll create models using seed as both a numeric variable and a factor.\nHowever, first, we need to encode seed as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness_factor &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = as.ordered(seed)) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = fct_relevel\n         (seed, \n           c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \n             \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \n             \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \n             \"16\")))\n\nGiven that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness_factor)\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, both models don’t appear to be significantly different from each other. Now, if we wanted to formally evaluate which is the better approach we could use likelihood-based model selection tools.\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2117.42\n4238.84\n4250.12\n1610.34\n2082\n2084\n\n\n\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2079.52\n4191.04\n4281.31\n1534.54\n2068\n2084\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on lower residual deviance, higher log-likelihood, and a lower AIC, the model that treats seed as a factor fits the data better. This would suggest that the relationship between tournament seed and number of wins is not linear, and would support using an approach that does not assume a constant effect per unit change in seed.\nHowever, before deciding on using a more complex model, we can evaluate if this complexity offers a significantly better modeling approach. To do this, we can perform a likelihood ratio test.\n\\(H_0\\): Model poisson_model fits the data better than model poisson_model_factor\n\\(H_a\\): Model poisson_model_factor fits the data better than model poisson_model\n\nanova_result &lt;- tidy(anova(poisson_model, poisson_model_factor, test = \"Chisq\"))\n\nkable(anova_result, digits = 2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf.residual\nresidual.deviance\ndf\ndeviance\np.value\n\n\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2082\n1610.34\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2068\n1534.54\n14\n75.79\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results indicate strong evidence that the model with seed treated as a factor fits the data significantly better than treating it as a numeric predictor. Therefore, we will proceed by using seed as a factor.\n\n\n4. Overdispersion Testing\nIt is noteworthy that Poisson assumes that the mean is equal to the variance of the count variable. If the variance is much greater, we might need a Negative Binomial model. We can do an dispersion test to evaluate this matter.\nLetting \\(Y_i\\) be the \\(ith\\) Poisson response in the count regression model, in the presence of equidispersion, \\(Y_i\\) has the following parameters:\n\\(E(Y_i)=\\lambda_i, Var(Y_i)=\\lambda_i\\)\nThe test uses the following mathematical expression (using a \\(1+\\gamma\\) dispersion factor):\n\\(Var(Y_i)=(1+\\gamma)*\\lambda_i\\)\nwith the hypotheses:\n\\(H_0:1 + \\gamma = 1\\)\n\\(H_a: 1 + \\gamma &gt; 1\\)\nWhen there is evidence of overdispersion in our data, we will reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nkable(tidy(dispersiontest(poisson_model_factor)), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n0.96\n-0.56\n0.71\nOverdispersion test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the P-value (0.71) is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant evidence of overdispersion in the Poisson model.\n\n\n5.
