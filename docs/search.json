Companies are increasingly being evaluated not only on financial metrics but also on their social and governance performance, including how they support gender equity.

The following box plot illustrates how scores vary by ownership category\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- gender_data |&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(score) & !is.na(ownership))\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = ownership, y = score, fill = ownership)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Public\" = \"#1f77b4\",     # blue\n    \"Private\" = \"#6baed6\",    # lighter blue\n    \"Government\" = \"#08306b\"  # dark blue\n  )) +\n  labs(title = \"Score by Ownership Type\", x = \"Ownership\", y = \"Score\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing: Gender Assessment Scores by Ownership Type\nWe aim to test whether companies with different ownership types have significantly different mean gender assessment scores.\nHypotheses\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀):\nThe mean score is the same across all ownership groups.\n\\[\n\\mu_{\\text{public}} = \\mu_{\\text{Private}} = \\mu_{\\text{Government}}\n\\]\nAlternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):\nNot all group means are equal.\n\n\nAssumption checks for ANOVA\nBefore applying ANOVA to compare gender assessment scores across ownership types, it is essential to verify that the assumptions underlying the test are met.\n1. Independence of Observations\n\nObservations within and across groups must be independent: This assumption is satisfied by the data set design, provided that each company appears only once. This assumption is generally satisfied by the data set design, provided that each company appears only once and that there is no clustering of related firms or repeated measurements. Since our data set includes one record per company without repeated measures, we consider the independence assumption to be reasonably met.\n\n2. Normality of Residuals\nANOVA assumes that the residuals are normally distributed. We assess this using the Shapiro-Wilk test:\n\nanova_model &lt;- aov(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data)\nshapiro.test(residuals(anova_model))\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  residuals(anova_model)\nW = 0.98844, p-value = 1.423e-11\n\n\nInference\nSince the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of normality. The residuals are not normally distributed, violating the normality assumption for ANOVA.\n3. Homogeneity of Variances\nAnother key assumption is that the variance of scores is roughly equal across the ownership types. We use Levene’s Test to assess this:\n\nleveneTest(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data)\n\nWarning in leveneTest.default(y = y, group = group, ...): group coerced to\nfactor.\n\n\nLevene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)\n        Df F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \ngroup    2  25.558 1.097e-11 ***\n      1993                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nInference: As the p-value is well below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of equal variances. The assumption of homogeneity of variance is violated.\nSince both the normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance assumptions are violated, a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA is more appropriate.\n\n\n4. Kruskal-Wallis test\nTo evaluate whether the score differs across different types of business ownership, we use the Kruskal–Wallis test.\nHypotheses\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀):\nThe median score is the same across all ownership groups.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{public}} = \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{Private}} = \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{Government}}\n\\]\nAlternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):\nNot all group medians are equal.\n\n\nAssumptions of the Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\nOrdinal or Continuous Dependent Variable: The variable score is numeric, satisfying this assumption.\nIndependent Groups: Each business (or observation) belongs to only one ownership type. This ensures group independence.\nIndependent Observations: Each row in the data set represents a unique business entity, so the observations are independent.\n\n\nkruskal.test(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data)\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  score by ownership\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 517.7, df = 2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\n\nThe p-value is small (&lt; 0.05), meaning we reject the null hypothesis (H₀) that all ownership groups have the same median score.\nThere are statistically significant differences in median score between at least two ownership types.\n\nSince the test indicates that not all ownership groups are equal, we need to conduct a post-hoc test to identify which specific groups differ.\n\n\n5. Dunn’s Post-Hoc Test (with Bonferroni Correction)\nTo determine which ownership groups differ, we conduct Dunn’s test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.\n\n# Run Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction\ndunnTest(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data, method = \"bonferroni\")\n\nWarning: ownership was coerced to a factor.\n\n\nWarning: Some rows deleted from 'x' and 'g' because missing data.\n\n\nDunn (1964) Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison\n\n\n  p-values adjusted with the Bonferroni method.\n\n\n            Comparison          Z      P.unadj        P.adj\n1 Government - Private  -4.232728 2.308732e-05 6.926197e-05\n2  Government - Public -18.867414 2.113945e-79 6.341836e-79\n3     Private - Public -16.052311 5.507422e-58 1.652227e-57\n\n\nInference\nPairwise comparisons using Dunn’s test (with Bonferroni correction) indicate statistically significant differences in gender assessment scores across all ownership types:\n\nGovernment-owned companies have significantly lower scores than both Private and Public companies.\nPrivate companies also score significantly lower than Public companies.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis highlights notable disparities in gender assessment performance across industries, ownership types, and regions. Industries demonstrated varying levels of engagement with gender equity, with the Personal & Household Products sector achieving the highest average scores. In contrast, the Pension Funds industry consistently lagged behind, pointing to potential structural or cultural barriers that may impede progress in specific sectors.\nOwnership structure played a critical role in performance. Government-owned companies significantly outperformed both privately held and publicly traded firms. In contrast, publicly traded companies, despite their visibility and access to resources, showed relatively poor performance.\nDespite the insights provided, this analysis faces some limitations. While average scores are useful for summarizing overall trends, they can hide meaningful differences within subgroup like firm size or revenue."

    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nHow much does a team’s tournament seed predict its success in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament?\nThis analysis explores the relationship between a team’s seed and its results on a tournament to evaluate whether teams with lower seeds consistently outperform ones with higher seeds.\nBy examining historical data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify trends in tournament advancement by seed level\n\nSeeding is intended to reflect a team’s regular-season performance. In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance. But upsets, bracket surprises, and standout performances from lower seeds raise questions like “How reliable is seeding as a predictor of success?”\nUnderstanding these dynamics can inform fan expectations and bracket predictions.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe should load the necessary libraries we will be using, including the diversedata package.\n\nlibrary(diversedata)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\n1. Data Cleaning & Processing\nFirst, let’s load our data (womensmarchmadness from diversedata package) and remove all NA values for our variables of interest seed and tourney_wins.\n\n# Reading Data\nmarchmadness &lt;- womensmarchmadness\n\n# Review total rows\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n# Removing NA but only in selected columns\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; drop_na(seed, tourney_wins)\n\n# Notice no rows were removed\nnrow(marchmadness)\n\n[1] 2092\n\n\nNote that, the seed = 0 designation in 1983 notes the eight teams that played an opening-round game to become the No.8 seed in each region. For this exercise, we will not take them into consideration. Since seed is an ordinal categorical variable, we can set it as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(seed != 0)\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe can see which seeds appear more often.\n\nseed_count &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  count(seed) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed))\n\nggplot(\n  seed_count, \n  aes(x = seed, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Seeds\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Number of Teams\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the average tournament wins for each seed:\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_tourney_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_tourney_wins)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = as.factor(seed),\n      y = avg_tourney_wins)\n    ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Avg. Tourney Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can note that a teams with a higher seed tend to win more tournaments! We can also see the total amount of tourney wins for each seed.\n\nseed_order &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_wins)) |&gt; \n  pull(seed)\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed_order)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)\n  ) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.25, color = \"skyblue2\") +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Tournament Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Seed Treatment: Numeric vs Factor\nAn important decision on this analysis is whether to use seed as a numeric or an ordered categorical predictor. Treating seed as a numeric explanatory variable assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\nTo test if this assumption is appropriate, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed. We’ll create models using seed as both a numeric variable and a factor.\nHowever, first, we need to encode seed as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness_factor &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = as.ordered(seed)) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = fct_relevel\n         (seed, \n           c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \n             \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \n             \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \n             \"16\")))\n\nGiven that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness_factor)\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, both models don’t appear to be significantly different from each other. Now, if we wanted to formally evaluate which is the better approach we could use likelihood-based model selection tools.\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2117.42\n4238.84\n4250.12\n1610.34\n2082\n2084\n\n\n\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2079.52\n4191.04\n4281.31\n1534.54\n2068\n2084\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on lower residual deviance, higher log-likelihood, and a lower AIC, the model that treats seed as a factor fits the data better. This would suggest that the relationship between tournament seed and number of wins is not linear, and would support using an approach that does not assume a constant effect per unit change in seed.\nHowever, before deciding on using a more complex model, we can evaluate if this complexity offers a significantly better modeling approach. To do this, we can perform a likelihood ratio test.\n\\(H_0\\): Model poisson_model fits the data better than model poisson_model_factor\n\\(H_a\\): Model poisson_model_factor fits the data better than model poisson_model\n\nanova_result &lt;- tidy(anova(poisson_model, poisson_model_factor, test = \"Chisq\"))\n\nkable(anova_result, digits = 2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf.residual\nresidual.deviance\ndf\ndeviance\np.value\n\n\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2082\n1610.34\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2068\n1534.54\n14\n75.79\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results indicate strong evidence that the model with seed treated as a factor fits the data significantly better than treating it as a numeric predictor. Therefore, we will proceed by using seed as a factor.\n\n\n4. Overdispersion Testing\nIt is noteworthy that Poisson assumes that the mean is equal to the variance of the count variable. If the variance is much greater, we might need a Negative Binomial model. We can do an dispersion test to evaluate this matter.\nLetting \\(Y_i\\) be the \\(ith\\) Poisson response in the count regression model, in the presence of equidispersion, \\(Y_i\\) has the following parameters:\n\\(E(Y_i)=\\lambda_i, Var(Y_i)=\\lambda_i\\)\nThe test uses the following mathematical expression (using a \\(1+\\gamma\\) dispersion factor):\n\\(Var(Y_i)=(1+\\gamma)\\times\\lambda_i\\)\nwith the hypotheses:\n\\(H_0:1 + \\gamma = 1\\)\n\\(H_a: 1 + \\gamma &gt; 1\\)\nWhen there is evidence of overdispersion in our data, we will reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nkable(tidy(dispersiontest(poisson_model_factor)), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n0.96\n-0.56\n0.71\nOverdispersion test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the P-value (0.71) is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant evidence of overdispersion in the Poisson model.\n\n\n5.

These results can be interpreted as:\nSeed 2 teams are expected to win 29% fewer games than Seed 1 teams\n\nSeed 2 teams are expected to win 29% (1-0.71) fewer games than Seed 1 teams.\nSeed 3 teams are expected to win 28% fewer games than Seed 2 teams.\nSeed 5 teams are expected to win 37% fewer games than Seed 4 teams.\nSeed 8 teams are expected to win 29% fewer games than Seed 7 teams.\nSeed 12 teams are expected to win 48% fewer games than Seed 11 teams.\nSeed 13 teams are expected to win 60% fewer games than Seed 12 teams.\n\nThis conclusion is easier to interpret visually, so, let’s plot our Poisson regression model to view the impact of seed on tourney_wins:\n\nmarchmadness$predicted_wins &lt;- predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n\nmodel_plot &lt;- ggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_wins), color = \"skyblue2\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Poisson Regression: Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nmodel_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis examined the relationship between a team’s tournament seed and its performance in the NCAA Division 1 Women’s Basketball Tournament. The results suggest that:\n\nPoisson regression supports seeding as a predictor: The Poisson regression model indicates that seed is a significant predictor of tournament wins, suggesting that higher-ranked teams tend to win more, even between closely ranked seeds.\nProper variable coding is essential: Treating seed as a numeric variable would assume a linear relationship on the log scale of expected tournament wins, meaning each one-unit increase in seed (e.g., from 1 to 2, or 10 to 11) would be associated with the same proportional decrease in wins. This oversimplifies the real pattern. By encoding seed as an ordered factor, the model can estimate distinct effects for each seed level, allowing for more accurate and nuanced interpretation.\nThere is a lot of variation around the prediction: While seeding generally reflects team strength, upsets and unexpected performances do occur, showing that other factors also influence tournament outcomes.\n\nSeeding is an important predictor of success, but clearly other factors influence the results. Unexpected performances are common in March Madness, so investigating additional variables could provide a fuller picture of what drives tournament outcomes."

This helps reveal regional concentrations, uncover potential economic hubs, and provide insights for targeted policy or investment strategies.\n\n\nAnalysis\nLoading Libraries\n\nlibrary(diversedata) \nlibrary(tidyverse)  # Loads dplyr, tidyr, stringr, ggplot2, etc.\nlibrary(infer)      # For chi-square test\nlibrary(dbscan)     # For clustering\nlibrary(leaflet)    # For interactive maps\nlibrary(treemapify) # For creating treemaps\n\n\n1.

Chi-Squared Test of Independence\nTo better understand the relationship between Indigenous business locations and their characteristics, we test whether type (ownership type) is independent of region using a Chi-square test.\nHypotheses\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): Business ownership type and region are independent. That is, the distribution of ownership types is the same across all regions.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): Business ownership type and region are dependent. That is, the distribution of ownership types differs by region.\n\nChi-squared Assumption Check\n\nData in Frequency Form: The data used in this test are raw counts of business records, not percentages or proportions.\nCategorical Variables: Both variables under study, type and region are categorical and represent discrete groups.\nIndependence of Observations: Each row in the data set corresponds to a unique business. There is no duplication, satisfying the assumption of independence.\nExpected Count: The Chi-square test expects that all expected cell frequencies are ≥ 5. In our case this assumption is violated.\n\n\n## Assumptions check\n\n# Step 1: Chi-Square Assumption Check\ntype_region_table &lt;- table(indigenousbiz_data$type, indigenousbiz_data$region)\nchisq_result &lt;- chisq.test(type_region_table)\n\nWarning in chisq.test(type_region_table): Chi-squared approximation may be\nincorrect\n\nexpected_counts &lt;- chisq_result$expected\n\nmin_expected &lt;- min(expected_counts)\n\ncat(\"Chi-Square Assumptions:\\n\")\n\nChi-Square Assumptions:\n\ncat(\"- Minimum expected count:\", round(min_expected, 2), \"\\n\")\n\n- Minimum expected count: 0.01 \n\nif (min_expected &gt;= 5) {\n  cat(\"Chi-squared assumptions met.

Proceeding with simulation-based Chi-squared test.\n\n\nSimulation-based Chi-Square Test with infer\nSince the assumption regarding minimum expected cell counts was violated with at least one expected frequency falling below the threshold of 5. The Chi-squared test may yield inaccurate results. To overcome this, we use a simulation-based Chi-squared test via the infer package. This method generates a null distribution by permuting the data under the assumption of independence.\nThe simulation-based tests still require some assumptions to hold:\n- The data must represent independent observations.\n\nThe variables must be categorical.\nThe permutations assume that under the null hypothesis, the distribution of values across categories is exchangeable.\n\n\n# Generate null distribution\nnull_distribution &lt;- indigenousbiz_data |&gt;\n  specify(type ~ region) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"Chisq\")\n\nWarning: Removed 136 rows containing missing values.\n\n# Observed statistic\nobserved_stat &lt;- indigenousbiz_data |&gt;\n  specify(type ~ region) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"Chisq\")\n\nWarning: Removed 136 rows containing missing values.\n\n# Plot permutation distribution\nnull_distribution |&gt;\n  visualize() +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = \"greater\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Compute p-value\np_val &lt;- null_distribution |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = \"greater\")\n\nWarning: Please be cautious in reporting a p-value of 0. This result is an approximation\nbased on the number of `reps` chosen in the `generate()` step.\nℹ See `get_p_value()` (`?infer::get_p_value()`) for more information.\n\ncat(\"Simulation-based p-value:\", round(p_val$p_value, 4), \"\\n\")\n\nSimulation-based p-value: 0 \n\n\nInference\nTo assess whether there is an association between business type and region, we conducted a simulation-based chi-squared test using 1,000 permutations. The null distribution of test statistics generated under the assumption of independence shows that our observed statistic lies far in the tail of the distribution. This suggests that such an extreme result would be highly unlikely if business type and region were truly independent. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that business type and region are statistically dependent.\n\n\n4. Spatial Clustering of Indigenous Businesses using DBSCAN\nTo explore geographic patterns in Indigenous business, the technique of clustering based on latitude and longitude coordinates was applied. This analysis revealed several spatial clusters of Indigenous businesses across British Columbia.

The statistical and spatial explorations reveal that both regional context and business structure are deeply intertwined with Indigenous entrepreneurship.\nThe Chi-square test of independence, supported by simulation-based inference due to assumption violations, reveals a statistically significant association between business ownership type and geographic region. This suggests that certain forms of business organization such as community-owned enterprises or private companies may be more prevalent in specific regions, potentially influenced by local governance structures, access to funding, or historical land use patterns.\nThe spatial clustering using DBSCAN further enriches this narrative by identifying natural groupings of businesses based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. These clusters likely reflect real-world economic and social hubs within the province. The treemap visualization provides a clear breakdown of dominant industry sectors within each spatial cluster, especially after aggregating less-represented sectors into an ‘Other’ category for interpretability.\nIn summary, this analysis highlights how Indigenous business patterns in British Columbia are shaped by both geographic and organizational factors. While insightful, the findings should be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional nature of the data and sensitivity of the clustering method."

Gender Assessment Score by Ownership Type\nIn addition to industry-based analysis, we examine whether ownership structure affects the overall gender performance scores. The following box plot illustrates how scores vary by ownership category\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- gender_data |&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(score) & !is.na(ownership))\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = ownership, y = score, fill = ownership)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Public\" = \"#1f77b4\",     # blue\n    \"Private\" = \"#6baed6\",    # lighter blue\n    \"Government\" = \"#08306b\"  # dark blue\n  )) +\n  labs(title = \"Score by Ownership Type\", x = \"Ownership\", y = \"Score\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing: Gender Assessment Scores by Ownership Type\nWe aim to test whether companies with different ownership types have significantly different mean gender assessment scores.\nHypotheses\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀):\nThe mean score is the same across all ownership groups.\n\\[\n\\mu_{\\text{public}} = \\mu_{\\text{Private}} = \\mu_{\\text{Government}}\n\\]\nAlternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):\nNot all group means are equal.\n\n\nAssumption checks for ANOVA\nBefore applying ANOVA to compare gender assessment scores across ownership types, it is essential to verify that the assumptions underlying the test are met.\n1. Independence of Observations\n\nObservations within and across groups must be independent: This assumption is satisfied by the data set design, provided that each company appears only once. This assumption is generally satisfied by the data set design, provided that each company appears only once and that there is no clustering of related firms or repeated measurements. Since our data set includes one record per company without repeated measures, we consider the independence assumption to be reasonably met.\n\n2. Normality of Residuals\nANOVA assumes that the residuals are normally distributed. We assess this using the Shapiro-Wilk test:\n\nanova_model &lt;- aov(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data)\nshapiro.test(residuals(anova_model))\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  residuals(anova_model)\nW = 0.98844, p-value = 1.423e-11\n\n\nInference\nSince the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of normality. The residuals are not normally distributed, violating the normality assumption for ANOVA.\n3. Homogeneity of Variances\nAnother key assumption is that the variance of scores is roughly equal across the ownership types. We use Levene’s Test to assess this:\n\nleveneTest(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data)\n\nWarning in leveneTest.default(y = y, group = group, ...): group coerced to\nfactor.\n\n\nLevene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)\n        Df F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \ngroup    2  25.558 1.097e-11 ***\n      1993                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nInference: As the p-value is well below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of equal variances. The assumption of homogeneity of variance is violated.\nSince both the normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance assumptions are violated, a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA is more appropriate.\n\n\n4. Kruskal-Wallis test\nTo evaluate whether the score differs across different types of business ownership, we use the Kruskal–Wallis test.\nHypotheses\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀):\nThe median score is the same across all ownership groups.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{public}} = \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{Private}} = \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{Government}}\n\\]\nAlternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):\nNot all group medians are equal.\n\n\nAssumptions of the Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\nOrdinal or Continuous Dependent Variable: The variable score is numeric, satisfying this assumption.\nIndependent Groups: Each business (or observation) belongs to only one ownership type. This ensures group independence.\nIndependent Observations: Each row in the data set represents a unique business entity, so the observations are independent.\n\n\nkruskal.test(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data)\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  score by ownership\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 517.7, df = 2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\n\nThe p-value is small (&lt; 0.05), meaning we reject the null hypothesis (H₀) that all ownership groups have the same median score.\nThere are statistically significant differences in median score between at least two ownership types.\n\nSince the test indicates that not all ownership groups are equal, we need to conduct a post-hoc test to identify which specific groups differ.\n\n\n5. Dunn’s Post-Hoc Test (with Bonferroni Correction)\nTo determine which ownership groups differ, we conduct Dunn’s test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.\n\n# Run Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction\ndunnTest(score ~ ownership, data = gender_data, method = \"bonferroni\")\n\nWarning: ownership was coerced to a factor.\n\n\nWarning: Some rows deleted from 'x' and 'g' because missing data.\n\n\nDunn (1964) Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison\n\n\n  p-values adjusted with the Bonferroni method.\n\n\n            Comparison          Z      P.unadj        P.adj\n1 Government - Private  -4.232728 2.308732e-05 6.926197e-05\n2  Government - Public -18.867414 2.113945e-79 6.341836e-79\n3     Private - Public -16.052311 5.507422e-58 1.652227e-57\n\n\nInference\nPairwise comparisons using Dunn’s test (with Bonferroni correction) indicate statistically significant differences in gender assessment scores across all ownership types:\n\nGovernment-owned companies have significantly lower scores than both Private and Public companies.\nPrivate companies also score significantly lower than Public companies.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis highlights notable disparities in gender assessment performance across industries, ownership types, and regions. Industries demonstrated varying levels of engagement with gender equity, with the Personal & Household Products sector achieving the highest average scores. In contrast, the Pension Funds industry consistently lagged behind, pointing to potential structural or cultural barriers that may impede progress in specific sectors.\nOwnership structure played a critical role in performance. Government-owned companies significantly outperformed both privately held and publicly traded firms. In contrast, publicly traded companies, despite their visibility and access to resources, showed relatively poor performance.\nDespite the insights provided, this analysis faces some limitations. While average scores are useful for summarizing overall trends, they can hide meaningful differences within subgroup like firm size or revenue."

Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe can see which seeds appear more often.\n\nseed_count &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  count(seed) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed))\n\nggplot(\n  seed_count, \n  aes(x = seed, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Seeds\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Number of Teams\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at the average tournament wins for each seed:\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_tourney_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_tourney_wins)) |&gt;\n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = as.factor(seed),\n      y = avg_tourney_wins)\n    ) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Avg. Tourney Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can note that a teams with a higher seed tend to win more tournaments! We can also see the total amount of tourney wins for each seed.\n\nseed_order &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(seed) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_wins = mean(tourney_wins, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_wins)) |&gt; \n  pull(seed)\n\nmarchmadness |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(seed), seed != 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = factor(seed, levels = seed_order)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)\n  ) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.25, color = \"skyblue2\") +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n    x = \"Seed\",\n    y = \"Tournament Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Seed Treatment: Numeric vs Factor\nAn important decision on this analysis is whether to use seed as a numeric or an ordered categorical predictor. Treating seed as a numeric explanatory variable assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\nTo test if this assumption is appropriate, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed. We’ll create models using seed as both a numeric variable and a factor.\nHowever, first, we need to encode seed as an ordered factor.\n\nmarchmadness_factor &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = as.ordered(seed)) |&gt; \n  mutate(seed = fct_relevel\n         (seed, \n           c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \n             \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \n             \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \n             \"16\")))\n\nGiven that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness_factor)\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, both models don’t appear to be significantly different from each other. Now, if we wanted to formally evaluate which is the better approach we could use likelihood-based model selection tools.\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2117.42\n4238.84\n4250.12\n1610.34\n2082\n2084\n\n\n\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2079.52\n4191.04\n4281.31\n1534.54\n2068\n2084\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on lower residual deviance, higher log-likelihood, and a lower AIC, the model that treats seed as a factor fits the data better. This would suggest that the relationship between tournament seed and number of wins is not linear, and would support using an approach that does not assume a constant effect per unit change in seed.\nHowever, before deciding on using a more complex model, we can evaluate if this complexity offers a significantly better modeling approach. To do this, we can perform a likelihood ratio test.\n\\(H_0\\): Model poisson_model fits the data better than model poisson_model_factor\n\\(H_a\\): Model poisson_model_factor fits the data better than model poisson_model\n\nanova_result &lt;- tidy(anova(poisson_model, poisson_model_factor, test = \"Chisq\"))\n\nkable(anova_result, digits = 2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf.residual\nresidual.deviance\ndf\ndeviance\np.value\n\n\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2082\n1610.34\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ntourney_wins ~ seed\n2068\n1534.54\n14\n75.79\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results indicate strong evidence that the model with seed treated as a factor fits the data significantly better than treating it as a numeric predictor. Therefore, we will proceed by using seed as a factor.\n\n\n4. Overdispersion Testing\nIt is noteworthy that Poisson assumes that the mean is equal to the variance of the count variable. If the variance is much greater, we might need a Negative Binomial model. We can do an dispersion test to evaluate this matter.\nLetting \\(Y_i\\) be the \\(ith\\) Poisson response in the count regression model, in the presence of equidispersion, \\(Y_i\\) has the following parameters:\n\\(E(Y_i)=\\lambda_i, Var(Y_i)=\\lambda_i\\)\nThe test uses the following mathematical expression (using a \\(1+\\gamma\\) dispersion factor):\n\\(Var(Y_i)=(1+\\gamma)\\times\\lambda_i\\)\nwith the hypotheses:\n\\(H_0:1 + \\gamma = 1\\)\n\\(H_a: 1 + \\gamma &gt; 1\\)\nWhen there is evidence of overdispersion in our data, we will reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nkable(tidy(dispersiontest(poisson_model_factor)), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n0.96\n-0.56\n0.71\nOverdispersion test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the P-value (0.71) is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant evidence of overdispersion in the Poisson model.\n\n\n5. Hypothesis Testing: Are Seed and Wins Associated?\n\nsummary_model &lt;- tidy(poisson_model_factor) |&gt; \n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt;= 0.05)\n  \nkable(summary_model, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nexp_estimate\n\n\n\n\nseed2-1\n-0.34\n0.07\n-4.96\n0.00\n0.71\n\n\nseed3-2\n-0.33\n0.08\n-4.05\n0.00\n0.72\n\n\nseed5-4\n-0.46\n0.10\n-4.34\n0.00\n0.63\n\n\nseed8-7\n-0.34\n0.15\n-2.22\n0.03\n0.71\n\n\nseed12-11\n-0.64\n0.23\n-2.75\n0.01\n0.52\n\n\nseed13-12\n-0.92\n0.38\n-2.40\n0.02\n0.40\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we can see that seed is significantly associated with tourney_wins, particularly in changes in levels between lower seeds. These results can be interpreted as:\nSeed 2 teams are expected to win 29% fewer games than Seed 1 teams\n\nSeed 2 teams are expected to win 29% (1-0.71) fewer games than Seed 1 teams.\nSeed 3 teams are expected to win 28% fewer games than Seed 2 teams.\nSeed 5 teams are expected to win 37% fewer games than Seed 4 teams.\nSeed 8 teams are expected to win 29% fewer games than Seed 7 teams.\nSeed 12 teams are expected to win 48% fewer games than Seed 11 teams.\nSeed 13 teams are expected to win 60% fewer games than Seed 12 teams.\n\nThis conclusion is easier to interpret visually, so, let’s plot our Poisson regression model to view the impact of seed on tourney_wins:\n\nmarchmadness$predicted_wins &lt;- predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n\nmodel_plot &lt;- ggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_wins), color = \"skyblue2\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Poisson Regression: Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nmodel_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis examined the relationship between a team’s tournament seed and its performance in the NCAA Division 1 Women’s Basketball Tournament. The results suggest that:\n\nPoisson regression supports seeding as a predictor: The Poisson regression model indicates that seed is a significant predictor of tournament wins, suggesting that higher-ranked teams tend to win more, even between closely ranked seeds.\nProper variable coding is essential: Treating seed as a numeric variable would assume a linear relationship on the log scale of expected tournament wins, meaning each one-unit increase in seed (e.g., from 1 to 2, or 10 to 11) would be associated with the same proportional decrease in wins. This oversimplifies the real pattern. By encoding seed as an ordered factor, the model can estimate distinct effects for each seed level, allowing for more accurate and nuanced interpretation.\nThere is a lot of variation around the prediction: While seeding generally reflects team strength, upsets and unexpected performances do occur, showing that other factors also influence tournament outcomes.\n\nSeeding is an important predictor of success, but clearly other factors influence the results. Unexpected performances are common in March Madness, so investigating additional variables could provide a fuller picture of what drives tournament outcomes."

Chi-Squared Test of Independence\nTo better understand the relationship between Indigenous business locations and their characteristics, we test whether type (ownership type) is independent of region using a Chi-square test.\nHypotheses\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): Business ownership type and region are independent. That is, the distribution of ownership types is the same across all regions.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): Business ownership type and region are dependent. That is, the distribution of ownership types differs by region.\n\nChi-squared Assumption Check\n\nData in Frequency Form: The data used in this test are raw counts of business records, not percentages or proportions.\nCategorical Variables: Both variables under study, type and region are categorical and represent discrete groups.\nIndependence of Observations: Each row in the data set corresponds to a unique business. There is no duplication, satisfying the assumption of independence.\nExpected Count: The Chi-square test expects that all expected cell frequencies are ≥ 5. In our case this assumption is violated.\n\n\n## Assumptions check\n\n# Step 1: Chi-Square Assumption Check\ntype_region_table &lt;- table(indigenousbiz_data$type, indigenousbiz_data$region)\nchisq_result &lt;- chisq.test(type_region_table)\n\nWarning in chisq.test(type_region_table): Chi-squared approximation may be\nincorrect\n\nexpected_counts &lt;- chisq_result$expected\n\nmin_expected &lt;- min(expected_counts)\n\ncat(\"Chi-Square Assumptions:\\n\")\n\nChi-Square Assumptions:\n\ncat(\"- Minimum expected count:\", round(min_expected, 2), \"\\n\")\n\n- Minimum expected count: 0.01 \n\nif (min_expected &gt;= 5) {\n  cat(\"Chi-squared assumptions met.

Proceeding with simulation-based Chi-squared test.\n\n\nSimulation-based Chi-Square Test with infer\nSince the assumption regarding minimum expected cell counts was violated with at least one expected frequency falling below the threshold of 5. The Chi-squared test may yield inaccurate results. To overcome this, we use a simulation-based Chi-squared test via the infer package. This method generates a null distribution by permuting the data under the assumption of independence.\nThe simulation-based tests still require some assumptions to hold:\n- The data must represent independent observations.\n\nThe variables must be categorical.\nThe permutations assume that under the null hypothesis, the distribution of values across categories is exchangeable.\n\n\n# Generate null distribution\nnull_distribution &lt;- indigenousbiz_data |&gt;\n  specify(type ~ region) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"Chisq\")\n\nWarning: Removed 136 rows containing missing values.\n\n# Observed statistic\nobserved_stat &lt;- indigenousbiz_data |&gt;\n  specify(type ~ region) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"Chisq\")\n\nWarning: Removed 136 rows containing missing values.\n\n# Plot permutation distribution\nnull_distribution |&gt;\n  visualize() +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = \"greater\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Compute p-value\np_val &lt;- null_distribution |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = \"greater\")\n\ncat(\"Simulation-based p-value:\", round(p_val$p_value, 4), \"\\n\")\n\nSimulation-based p-value: 0.001 \n\n\nInference\nTo assess whether there is an association between business type and region, we conducted a simulation-based chi-squared test using 1,000 permutations. The null distribution of test statistics generated under the assumption of independence shows that our observed statistic lies far in the tail of the distribution. This suggests that such an extreme result would be highly unlikely if business type and region were truly independent. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that business type and region are statistically dependent.\n\n\n4. Spatial Clustering of Indigenous Businesses using DBSCAN\nTo explore geographic patterns in Indigenous business, the technique of clustering based on latitude and longitude coordinates was applied. This analysis revealed several spatial clusters of Indigenous businesses across British Columbia. The treemap provided more information on which were the prominent industries in each cluster.\n\n## DBSCAN Clustering and Leaflet Map\n\ncoords &lt;- indigenousbiz_data |&gt;\n  select(longitude, latitude) |&gt;\n  as.matrix()\n\nset.seed(123)\ndb &lt;- dbscan::dbscan(coords, eps = 1.2, minPts = 8)\n\nindigenousbiz_data &lt;- indigenousbiz_data |&gt;\n  mutate(cluster = factor(db$cluster))\n\npal &lt;- colorFactor(palette = \"Set1\", domain = indigenousbiz_data$cluster)\n\ncluster_map &lt;- leaflet(data = indigenousbiz_data) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  setView(lng = -125, lat = 54, zoom = 4.6) |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    label = ~business_name,\n    radius = 3,\n    color = ~pal(cluster),\n    stroke = FALSE,\n    fillOpacity = 0.7\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLegend(\n    position = \"bottomright\",\n    pal = pal,\n    values = ~cluster,\n    title = \"Cluster\",\n    opacity = 1\n  )\n\nAssuming \"longitude\" and \"latitude\" are longitude and latitude, respectively\n\ncluster_map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

The statistical and spatial explorations reveal that both regional context and business structure are deeply intertwined with Indigenous entrepreneurship.\nThe Chi-square test of independence, supported by simulation-based inference due to assumption violations, reveals a statistically significant association between business ownership type and geographic region. This suggests that certain forms of business organization such as community-owned enterprises or private companies may be more prevalent in specific regions, potentially influenced by local governance structures, access to funding, or historical land use patterns.\nThe spatial clustering using DBSCAN further enriches this narrative by identifying natural groupings of businesses based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. These clusters likely reflect real-world economic and social hubs within the province. The treemap visualization provides a clear breakdown of dominant industry sectors within each spatial cluster, especially after aggregating less-represented sectors into an ‘Other’ category for interpretability.\nIn summary, this analysis highlights how Indigenous business patterns in British Columbia are shaped by both geographic and organizational factors. While insightful, the findings should be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional nature of the data and sensitivity of the clustering method."

    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nWhat behavioral factors are strongly associated with relationship quality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? Are these factors different for same sex couples?\nThis case study examines the association between relationship_quality and a variety of behavioral and pandemic-related variables.\nBy examining survey data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify the behavioral factors that most strongly affect the perceived relationship quality. We will focus specifically on finding how sex_frequency, flirts_with_partner and fights_with_partner affect the perception of relationship quality and we are going to evaluate if these factors have a different impact on same sex couples (same_sex_couple).\nWe will also evaluate whether COVID-19 related factors such vaccination status (subject_vaccinated, partner_vaccinated), COVID-19 illness (subject_had_covid, partner_had_covid), income changes during the pandemic (inc_change_during_pandemic), and agreement on pandemic-related approaches (agree_covid_approach) affected couples’ perceived relationship quality.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nFirst, we need to load the libraries that will be used through the exercise, including the diversedata package.\n\nlibrary(diversedata)\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(brant)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\n1.

Variable Encoding\nWe can note that our categorical response follows a specific order. For this reason, we require a model that suits ordinal responses. Hence, we will be using an Ordinal Logistic regression model framework.\nIn order to do so, we need to make sure that our response variable is encoded as an ordered factor. We will also take this opportunity to encode our explanatory variables as factors (and ordered factors) as needed.\nFirst, we can encode our nominal categorical explanatory variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(same_sex_couple = as_factor(same_sex_couple)|&gt; \n           fct_recode(\"No\" = \"no\", \"Yes\" = \"yes\"))\n\nlevels(hcmst$same_sex_couple)\n\n[1] \"No\"  \"Yes\"\n\n\nThen, we can encode all our ordinal, categorical, explanatory, behavioral variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = as.ordered(sex_frequency)) |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = fct_relevel(sex_frequency, \n      c(\"once_a_month_or_less\", \"2_to_3_times_a_month\", \n        \"once_or_twice_a_week\", \"3_to_6_times_a_week\", \n        \"once_or_more_a_day\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(flirts_with_partner = as.ordered(flirts_with_partner)) |&gt; \n  mutate(flirts_with_partner = fct_relevel(flirts_with_partner, \n      c(\"never\", \"less_than_once_a_month\", \n        \"1_to_3_times_a_month\", \"once_a_week\", \n        \"a_few_times_a_week\", \"every_day\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$flirts_with_partner)\n\n[1] \"never\"                  \"less_than_once_a_month\" \"1_to_3_times_a_month\"  \n[4] \"once_a_week\"            \"a_few_times_a_week\"     \"every_day\"             \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(fights_with_partner = as.ordered(fights_with_partner)) |&gt; \n  mutate(fights_with_partner = fct_relevel(fights_with_partner, \n      c(\"0_times\", \"1_time\", \"2_times\", \"3_times\", \"4_times\", \n        \"5_times\", \"6_times\", \"7_or_more_times\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\n\nThen, we can encode all our ordinal, categorical, explanatory, COVID-19-related variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(inc_change_during_pandemic = as.ordered(inc_change_during_pandemic)) |&gt; \n  mutate(inc_change_during_pandemic = fct_relevel(inc_change_during_pandemic, \n      c(\"much_worse\", \"worse\", \"no_change\", \"better\", \"much_better\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$inc_change_during_pandemic)\n\n[1] \"much_worse\"  \"worse\"       \"no_change\"   \"better\"      \"much_better\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(subject_had_covid = as_factor(subject_had_covid))\n\nlevels(hcmst$subject_had_covid)\n\n[1] \"no\"  \"yes\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(partner_had_covid = as_factor(partner_had_covid))\n\nlevels(hcmst$partner_had_covid)\n\n[1] \"yes\" \"no\" \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(subject_vaccinated = as.ordered(subject_vaccinated)) |&gt; \n  mutate(subject_vaccinated = fct_relevel(subject_vaccinated, \n      c(\"not_vaccinated\", \"partially_vaccinated\", \n        \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\", \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$subject_vaccinated)\n\n[1] \"not_vaccinated\"               \"partially_vaccinated\"        \n[3] \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\"  \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(partner_vaccinated = as.ordered(partner_vaccinated)) |&gt; \n  mutate(partner_vaccinated = fct_relevel(partner_vaccinated, \n      c(\"not_vaccinated\", \"partially_vaccinated\", \n        \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\", \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$partner_vaccinated)\n\n[1] \"not_vaccinated\"               \"partially_vaccinated\"        \n[3] \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\"  \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(agree_covid_approach = as.ordered(agree_covid_approach)) |&gt; \n  mutate(agree_covid_approach = fct_relevel(agree_covid_approach, \n      c(\"completely_disagree\", \"mostly_disagree\", \n        \"mostly_agree\", \"completely_agree\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$agree_covid_approach)\n\n[1] \"completely_disagree\" \"mostly_disagree\"     \"mostly_agree\"       \n[4] \"completely_agree\"   \n\n\nFinally, we can encode our target variable:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(relationship_quality = as.ordered(relationship_quality)) |&gt; \n  mutate(relationship_quality = fct_relevel(relationship_quality, \n      c(\"very_poor\", \"poor\", \"fair\", \"good\", \"excellent\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\n\n\n\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe will visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables. But first, we will see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\n\n# We'll use a color blind friendly pallete:\ncbPalette &lt;- c(\"#0072B2\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#999999\", \"#E69F00\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\nggplot(hcmst, aes(x = same_sex_couple, fill = same_sex_couple)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Couple Type Distribution\",\n    x = \"Same Sex Couple\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, by = 100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is smaller that that of different-sex couples. In the original study, same sex couples were oversampled. For more information on how the survey data was collected, refer to the original data set.\nTo explore our other variables, we will create a function that will be used for visualization. Since we know that the samples for different types of couples are different, we will use relative frequency in our visualizations.\n\nhistogram_plot &lt;- function(data, y_var, facet, plot_title = \"Relative Frequency by Category\", label_map) {\n  data_long &lt;- data |&gt; \n    dplyr::select(all_of(c(y_var, facet))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = all_of(y_var), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n    mutate(value = recode(value, !!!label_map)) |&gt; \n    count(var, value, facet_value = .data[[facet]]) |&gt; \n    group_by(facet_value) |&gt; \n    mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt; \n    ungroup()\n\n  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = prop, y = value, fill = facet_value)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n      title = plot_title,\n      x = \"Relative Frequency\",\n      y = NULL,\n      fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette)\n}\n\n\nsex_freq_labels &lt;- c(\n  \"once_a_month_or_less\" = \"Once a Month or Less\",\n  \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" = \"Two or Three Times a Month\",\n  \"once_or_twice_a_week\" = \"Once or Twice a Week\",\n  \"3_to_6_times_a_week\" = \"Three to Six Times a Week\",\n  \"once_or_more_a_day\" = \"Once or More a Day\"\n)\n\nhist_sex_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"sex_frequency\", \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Sex Frequency\", label_map = sex_freq_labels)\n\nflirt_freq_labels &lt;- c(\n  \"never\" = \"Never\",\n  \"less_than_once_a_month\" = \"Less Than Once a Month\",\n  \"1_to_3_times_a_month\" = \"One to Three Times a Month\",\n  \"once_a_week\" = \"Once a Week\",\n  \"a_few_times_a_week\" = \"A Few Times a Week\",\n  \"every_day\" = \"Every Day\" \n)\n\nhist_flirt_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"flirts_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Flirting Frequency\",\n  label_map = flirt_freq_labels)\n\nfight_freq_labels &lt;- c(\n  \"0_times\" = \"Zero Times\",\n  \"1_time\" = \"One Time\",\n  \"2_times\" = \"Two Times\",\n  \"3_times\" = \"Three Times\",\n  \"4_times\" = \"Four Times\",\n  \"5_times\" = \"Five Times\",\n  \"6_times\" = \"Six Times\",\n  \"7_or_more_times\" = \"Seven or More Times\"\n)\n\nhist_fight_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"fights_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Fighting Frequency\",\n  label_map = fight_freq_labels)\n\ninc_labels &lt;- c(\n  \"much_worse\" = \"Much Worse\",\n  \"worse\" = \"Worse\",\n  \"no_change\" = \"No Change\",\n  \"better\" = \"Better\",\n  \"much_better\" = \"Much Better\"\n)\n\nhist_inc_change_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"inc_change_during_pandemic\",\n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Income Change During Pandemic Frequency\",\n  label_map = inc_labels)\n\nyes_no_label &lt;- c(\"no\" = \"No\", \"yes\" = \"Yes\")\n\nhist_sub_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"subject_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Subject had COVID-19 Frequency\",\n  label_map = yes_no_label)\n\nhist_par_covid_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"partner_had_covid\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Partner had COVID-19 Frequency\",\n  label_map = yes_no_label)\n\nvax_label &lt;- c(\n  \"not_vaccinated\" = \"Not Vaccinated\",\n  \"partially_vaccinated\" = \"Partially Vaccinated\",\n  \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\" = \"Fully Vaccinated No Booster\",\n  \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\" = \"Fully Vaccinated and Booster\"\n)\n\nhist_sub_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"subject_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Subject Vaccination Status Frequency\",\n  label_map = vax_label)\n\nhist_par_vax_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"partner_vaccinated\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Partner Vaccination Status Frequency\",\n  label_map = vax_label)\n\napproach_label &lt;- c(\n  \"completely_disagree\" = \"Completely Disagree\",\n  \"mostly_disagree\" = \"Mostly Disagree\",\n  \"mostly_agree\" = \"Mostly Agree\",\n  \"completely_agree\" = \"Completely Agree\"\n)\n\nhist_cov_approach_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"agree_covid_approach\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Agreement on Pandemic Approach Frequency\",\n  label_map = approach_label)\n\nquality_label &lt;- c(\n  \"very_poor\" =\"Very Poor\",\n  \"poor\" = \"Poor\",\n  \"fair\" = \"Fair\",\n  \"good\" = \"Good\",\n  \"excellent\" = \"Excellent\"\n)\n\nhist_quality_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(hcmst, \"relationship_quality\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", plot_title = \"Relationship Quality Frequency\",\n  label_map = quality_label)\n\nplot_grid(\n  hist_sex_freq,\n  hist_flirt_freq, \n  hist_fight_freq, \n  hist_inc_change_freq,\n  hist_sub_covid_freq,\n  hist_par_covid_freq,\n  hist_sub_vax_freq,\n  hist_par_vax_freq,\n  hist_cov_approach_freq,\n  hist_quality_freq,\n  ncol = 1, align = \"v\", axis = \"lr\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame-sex and different-sex couples show similar patters in how frequently they engage in sexual activity. However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency. We can also visualize how often couples flirt with or fight with their partners. The distribution of responses shows a tendency toward lower frequencies of both flirting and fighting.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be noted that most subjects had no change in income during the pandemic, did not have COVID, were fully vaccinated including the booster shot, and completely agreed with their partners in terms of their approach to the pandemic.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Model Fitting and Assumptions\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables, as well as COVID-19 related variables, affect the perception of relationship quality.

These are due to instances where combinations of the response variable and predictor levels have no observations. One warning from the Brant test indicates that over 3,000,000 combinations of the dependent variable (dv) and independent variables (ivs) are not present in the data set.\nWhen models include multiple categorical predictors with many levels, the number of possible combinations of predictors and outcomes grows exponentially. In real-world survey data, especially from large data sets, many of these combinations are either extremely rare or entirely missing. This sparsity can compromise the reliability of the Brant test, which assumes sufficient data within each combination to estimate parameters.\nOne potential solution is to bin levels of categorical variables that have low counts, reducing the number of empty combinations. However, when there are many predictors with multiple levels, even binning may not fully resolve the issue.\nThis limitation is common in multivariable modeling and reflects constraints in data collection and the inherent sparsity of data. As such, the results from diagnostics like the Brant test should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n5.

Prediction\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on behavioral and COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject. Focusing on the levels that were associated with statistically significant factors:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"Yes\",\n  sex_frequency = \"once_a_month_or_less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"a_few_times_a_week\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"1_time\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"worse\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"no\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"no\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"not_vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"not_vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"mostly_disagree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.08      0.32      0.41      0.17      0.02 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"No\",\n  sex_frequency = \"2_to_3_times_a_month\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"every_day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"0_times\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"no_change\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"no\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"no\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"not_vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"partially_vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"mostly_agree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.02      0.20      0.78 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a same-sex couple, who has sex once a month or less, flirts with their partner a few times a week, fought with their partner once in the last week, experienced worsened income during the pandemic, is not vaccinated (nor is their partner), and mostly disagrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 41% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair.\nOn the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex two or three times a month, flirts with their partner on a daily basis, has not fought with their partner in the last week, experienced no change in income during the pandemic, has a partially vaccinated partner, and mostly agrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 78% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how relationship habits, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to perceived relationship quality across different types of couples. Through the analysis, results highlight that relationship behaviors and shared beliefs meaningfully affect how individuals evaluate their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively.\nShared beliefs are beneficial: Agreement with a partner’s approach to COVID-19 was a very strong predictor of relationship quality. Moving in a direction of agreement had a significant positive association.\nExternal factors play a role as well: Financial stability during the pandemic, as well as the partner’s vaccination status were also linked to better relationship quality, suggesting that alignment on external factors, such as health and financial concerns, could cause stress in couple dynamics contribute to positive perceptions.\nPerceived relationship quality varied by couple type: Individuals in same-sex couples, on average, reported slightly lower relationship quality compared to those in different-sex couples. Although this difference was modest, it was statistically significant, which may warrant a need for further exploration into the factors that may influence these perceptions.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models. Also, encoding categorical predictors must be done with care to ensure meaningful and interpretable contrasts.\nSparsity may affect results: When categorical variables have many levels, certain combinations of predictors may be underrepresented. This sparsity may impact the model and its assumptions, so caution is advised when drawing conclusions from underpopulated subgroups."

Using a variety of visualization tools, we aim to identify where and how missing values occur across different variables.\nRather than ignoring or arbitrarily removing incomplete data, we apply imputation techniques to fill missing values.\n\n\nAnalysis\nLoading Libraries\n\n# Data\nlibrary(diversedata)      # Diverse Data Hub data set\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(VIM)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(mice)\n\n\n1.

Aggregation Plots\nThe first fundamental question to ask is: which variables contain missing values, and how many observations are affected? Aggregation plots are a useful tool to quickly summarize and visualize the extent of missingness across all variables in the data set.\nPlease note that :\n\nEach row in the plot represents a unique pattern of missingness across your variables. For example, one row might show only gdp-per-capita is missing and another might show edu_spend and employment are missing together.\nThe height of each bar on the left indicates the number (or percentage) of rows in our data that match that missing pattern.\n\n\n# Visualize missing values across all variables\ninvisible(\n  capture.output(\n    aggr(\n      cleaned_rights,\n      numbers = TRUE,\n      prop = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n      sortVars = TRUE,\n      cex.axis = 0.5,\n      las = 2,  # vertical labels\n      gap = 2,\n      col = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\"),\n      ylab = c(\"Missing Data (%)\", \"Missing Data Pattern\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aggregation plot provides a clear overview of missingness across variables in the data set. From this visualization, it is evident that several categorical variables particularly lgbtq-censorship, employment, and affirming-care contain substantial amounts of missing data. Among the continuous variables, education spending (edu-spend) stands out as having more missing values than gdp-per-capita, which may reflect inconsistencies in government reporting or data availability across countries. Many variables in this data set have missing values, so handling missing data is an important step in preparing the data.\nGiven the extent of missing data observed in the aggregation plot, we will take a closer look at selected variables to better understand the underlying patterns of missingness. Specifically, we focus on the following variables:\n\ngdp-per-capita and edu-spend, as key continuous indicators of national economic and educational investment. These variables are central to many of the analyses in this data set and missingness here may influence statistical outcomes if not properly addressed.\nsame-sex-marriage represents a key dimension of legal recognition for LGBTQ+ individuals. This categorical variable shows substantial missingness, which may reflect patterns tied to reporting practices or regional legal disparities in the recognition of same-sex unions. It includes seven categories that capture the varying legal statuses across countries: Banned, Civil union or other partnership, Unrecognized, Unregistered cohabitation, Legal, Varies by region, and Foreign same-sex marriages recognized only.\n\n\n\n3. Spinogram and Spineplot\nSo far, we have gained a high-level overview of missingness across the data set. To dig deeper, we now examine how missing values in one variable relate to the categories of another. This helps us understand whether missingness may be random or related to other features in the data.\nThe function spineMiss() from the {VIM} package is used for this purpose. It produces a spineplot, a type of bar chart that visualizes the distribution of missing vs. non-missing values in a variable (in this case, gdp) across the levels of a categorical variable (in this case, same-sex-marriage).\nBy running spineMiss(cleaned_rights[, c(\"marriage\", \"gdp\")]), we create a plot that shows, for each category of same-sex marriage recognition (e.g., Legal, Civil Union, Not Recognized), the proportion of observations where GDP is missing versus observed.\nThis visualization allows us to assess whether missing GDP values are evenly distributed across marriage groups (which might suggest MCAR: Missing Completely at Random), or if they are more prevalent in certain categories (which could suggest MAR: Missing at Random). It’s a helpful diagnostic tool to explore whether the missingness in gdp-per-capita is associated with legal recognition of same-sex marriage, which is crucial before deciding how to impute or model the data.\nPlease note that, based on Flexible Imputation of Missing Data by Stef van Buuren (2018), you can find the definitions as follows:\n\nMCAR (Missing Completely at Random): The probability of missingness is unrelated to any observed or unobserved data. In other words, missing data occur entirely at random.\nMAR (Missing at Random): The probability of missingness may depend on observed data but not on the missing values themselves. For example, GDP might be missing more often in countries without same-sex marriage laws, but not because of the GDP value itself.\nMNAR (Missing Not at Random): The probability of missingness depends on the value of the missing data itself. For example, countries with very low GDP might be less likely to report it.\n\n\n# Visualize missingness in GDP per capita across legal gender categories\npar(mar = c(10, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)\nspineMiss(cleaned_rights[, c(\"same_sex_marriage\", \"gdp_per_capita\")],\n          col = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\"),\n          cex.axis = 0.7,         \n          las = 2,                \n          xlab = \"Same Sex Marriage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spine plot shows that missing values in gdp-per-capita are not distributed evenly across the levels of same-sex-marriage recognition. Between seven categories, missingness is most frequent in countries where same-sex marriages are Unrecognized, followed by those where same-sex marriage is Banned, and then in countries where it is Legal.\nThis pattern suggests that the missingness in GDP is likely not completely at random, and may be associated with marriage recognition status, indicating a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism. Recognizing this pattern is important, as it can guide the selection of appropriate imputation strategies that account for such relationships.\n\n# Visualize missingness in education spending across legal gender categories\npar(mar = c(10, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)\nspineMiss(cleaned_rights[, c(\"same_sex_marriage\", \"edu_spend\")],\n          col = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\"),\n          cex.axis = 0.7,         \n          las = 2,                \n          xlab = \"Same Sex Marriage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spine plot for edu-spend across same-sex-marriage categories reveals that missing values are present in all levels of marriage recognition, unlike gdp, where missingness was more concentrated. Again between seven categories, missingness is most frequent in countries where same-sex marriages are Unrecognized, followed by those where same-sex marriage is Banned, and then in countries where it is Legal. We can also see that the Civil union or other partnership category has missing values\nThis widespread but uneven distribution suggests that the missingness in education spending is likely not completely at random (MCAR). Instead, it may be Missing At Random (MAR), as the probability of missing values appears to vary with observed levels of legal recognition. This pattern underscores the importance of considering contextual legal factors when handling missing values for edu-spend, as they may be informative and should influence imputation choices.\n\n\n4. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) using PMM\nWe used MICE with predictive mean matching (PMM) because it is well-suited to data sets with multiple partially missing variables, allows for realistic value imputation, and accommodates the MAR mechanism observed in o\nThrough earlier visualizations (like spineMiss and mosaicMiss), we observed that the missing values in gdp and edu_spend depend on other variables (e.g., marriage status). This suggests the data are Missing at Random (MAR) where imputation models should account for relationships between variables.\nWe used Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) to impute missing values in continuous variables like GDP and education spending. This method ensures that the imputed values are realistic and drawn from the actual data distribution, avoiding extreme or implausible results like negative GDP. Because these variables are often skewed, PMM offers a more robust alternative to linear regression.\nTo handle multiple variables with missing values, we applied the MICE algorithm, which builds a separate model for each incomplete variable using relevant predictors like marriage status, employment protection, and legal gender. This approach allows for flexible and iterative imputation, especially effective when missingness is spread across several variables.\nFinally, MICE generates multiple imputed data sets, which supports transparent and reproducible analysis while accounting for uncertainty in the missing data.\n\nimpute_df &lt;- cleaned_rights |&gt;\n  select(gdp_per_capita, edu_spend, same_sex_marriage, lgbtq_censorship, employment, affirming_care, legal_gender)\n\nimpute_df &lt;- impute_df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    marriage = as.factor(same_sex_marriage),\n    censorship = as.factor(lgbtq_censorship),\n    employment = as.factor(employment),\n    affirming_care = as.factor(affirming_care),\n    legal_gender = as.factor(legal_gender)\n  )\n\nset.seed(123)\nimputed &lt;- mice(impute_df, method = \"pmm\", m = 5)\n\n\n iter imp variable\n  1   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n\n\n\n\n5.

In this case study, we addressed missingness in both variables using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) with Predictive Mean Matching (PMM).\nBy including categorical predictors such as legal gender recognition, employment protection, marriage equality, and censorship laws, we aimed to generate imputations that reflect realistic values consistent with each country’s broader policy environment. The use of PMM ensured that imputed values were drawn from observed data points, preserving the original distribution and avoiding implausible values (e.g., negative GDP or unrealistic education spending).\nWe imputed both variables simultaneously within the same model, allowing the algorithm to borrow strength across variables and iterations. This approach reflects a more robust and context-aware method than imputing variables separately or using simple strategies like mean substitution.\nComparing the density plots of the original and imputed data revealed that the imputed values align well with the observed data distribution, suggesting that the imputations are not introducing substantial bias. This strengthens the reliability of subsequent statistical analyses such as ANOVA, regression modeling, or equity comparisons that rely on complete data sets.\nHowever, there are some limitations to consider. While MICE with PMM preserves distributional properties, it still assumes that the data are missing at random (MAR), which may not hold true in all contexts particularly when data availability is tied to political or economic instability. Moreover, the inclusion of policy indicators as predictors helps contextualize imputations but may also introduce circular reasoning if those same indicators are later used as outcomes in analysis. Future work could explore sensitivity analyses to assess how different imputation models affect results or incorporate external data sources to validate imputed values. Addressing these limitations would further strengthen the robustness and credibility of equity-focused policy research."

Identifying the key environmental and human factors linked to these fires can help guide more effective prevention and response strategies.\nSo, our main question is:\nCan we identify the environmental and human factors most associated with large wildfires?\nAccording to Natural Resources Canada, wildfires exceeding 200 hectares in final size are classified as “large fires.” While these fires represent a small percentage of all wildfires, they account for the majority of the total area burned annually.\nThe goal is to explore potential predictors of fire size, such as weather, fire cause, and detection method, and provide insights that could inform early interventions and resource planning.\n\n\nAnalysis\nLoading Libraries\n\n# Data\nlibrary(diversedata)      # Diverse Data Hub data sets\n\n# Core libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)        \nlibrary(lubridate)      \n\n# Spatial & mapping\nlibrary(sf)               \nlibrary(terra)            \nlibrary(ggmap)            \nlibrary(ggspatial)        \nlibrary(maptiles)         \nlibrary(leaflet)          \nlibrary(leaflet.extras)   \n\n# Visualization & color\nlibrary(viridis)          \n\n# Tables & reporting\nlibrary(gt)               \nlibrary(kableExtra)       \n\n# Modeling & interpretation\nlibrary(marginaleffects)  \nlibrary(broom)           \n\n\n1.

Exploratory Data Analysis\nMap of Wildfire Size and Location in Alberta\nThis interactive map displays the geographic distribution and relative size of wildfires across Alberta, using red circles sized by fire area. Each point represents a wildfire event, with larger circles indicating more extensive burns. The map reveals regions with concentrated wildfire activity and visually emphasizes differences in fire magnitude across the province.\n\nNote\nTo provide geographic context for our wildfire data, we added a shapefile representing Alberta’s boundaries.\nThis shapefile was sourced from the Alberta Government Open Data Portal and specifically corresponds to the Electoral Division Shapefile (Bill 33, 2017).\nThe data was processed and transformed to the appropriate geographic coordinate system to enable mapping alongside our wildfire data set.\n\n\n# map\nleaflet() |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"CartoDB.Positron\") |&gt; \n  setView(lng = -115, lat = 55, zoom = 5.5) |&gt; \n  addPolygons(data = alberta_shape, \n              color = \"#CCCCCC\",     \n              weight = 0.5,         \n              fillOpacity = 0.02,   \n              group = \"Alberta Boundaries\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(data = wildfire_sf,\n             radius = ~sqrt(current_size) * 30,  \n             fillOpacity = 0.6,\n             color = \"red\",\n             stroke = FALSE,\n             group = \"Wildfires\") |&gt;\n  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c(\"Alberta Boundaries\", \"Wildfires\"),\n                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) |&gt;\n  addLegend(position = \"bottomright\", \n            title = \"Wildfire Size (approx.)\",\n            colors = \"red\", \n            labels = \"Larger = Bigger fire\")\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of Large Fires by Cause\n\nwildfire_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(true_cause) |&gt;\n  summarize(prop_large = mean(large_fire, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  filter(prop_large &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(true_cause, prop_large), y = prop_large, fill = prop_large)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"skyblue1\", high = \"skyblue4\") +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Large Fires by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Fires &gt; 200 ha\",\n    fill = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Logistic Regression Model\nGovernments and emergency planners often care about whether a fire becomes large, not necessarily exactly how large. This makes a binary classification more interpretable and actionable for planning responses. Logistic regression predicts probability of exceeding a threshold, such as “Will this fire exceed 200 hectares?” Modeling the probability of exceeding such a threshold is often more operationally useful than modeling exact hectares.\nIn Decision Making for Wildfires: A Guide for Applying a Risk Management Process at the Incident Level, the authors outline a risk-based decision-making framework. A key concept is identifying risk thresholds to guide decisions. This aligns with the broader goals of wildfire risk management, which emphasize anticipating fire severity and planning appropriate responses. Logistic regression is well-suited to this context because it models the probability of crossing such thresholds, such as a fire becoming large, enabling a clear, interpretable basis for making timely, risk-informed decisions.\nWe built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a fire becoming large based on a set of environmental and operational factors that are consistently measurable, statistically significant, and operationally relevant.\nIn our logistic regression model, we selected key environmental and contextual variables from the wildfire_clean data set that are well-established drivers of wildfire behavior. These include:\n\ntemperature: Higher temperatures increase evaporation, dry out vegetation, and promote ignition and fire spread.\nwind_speed: Strong winds feed oxygen to the fire and can carry embers over long distances, accelerating spread.\nrelative_humidity: Low humidity conditions dry fuels, increasing the probability and intensity of fire ignition.\nfire_spread_rate: Reflects how quickly a fire expands; a dynamic indicator of fire behavior.\nfire_type: Indicates how the fire behaves (e.g., surface vs. crown fire), which affects controllability and risk.\nfuel_type: Different vegetation types burn at different intensities and rates; fuels like grass or timber respond differently under the same conditions.\nia_access: Stands for Initial Attack Access. Limited access can delay suppression efforts, allowing fires to grow larger.\n\nThese variables were chosen because they each represent core determinants of ignition likelihood, fire intensity, and suppression difficulty. As explained in Introduction to Wildland Fire by Pyne, Andrews, and Laven, this theoretical foundation supports our inclusion of both meteorological and environmental variables in the model.\nMathematical Definition of the Logistic Regression Model\nWe aim to estimate the probability that a wildfire becomes large (i.e., burns more than 200 hectares), using logistic regression.\nLet:\n\\[\nY_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if fire } i \\text{ is large (area &gt; 200 ha)} \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_i =\n\\left(\n\\text{temperature}_i,\n\\text{wind\\_speed}_i,\n\\text{relative\\_humidity}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_type}_i,\n\\text{fuel\\_type}_i,\n\\text{ia\\_access}_i\n\\right)\n\\]\nThen the model is defined as:\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta_i)}\n\\]\nwhere the linear predictor is:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0\n+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{temperature}_i\n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{wind\\_speed}_i\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{relative\\_humidity}_i\n+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i\n+ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}}\n\\]\nHere:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_0 & \\text{ is the intercept} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of coefficients for the categorical predictors} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of dummy variables representing those categorical predictors}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nmodel &lt;- glm(\n  large_fire ~ temperature + wind_speed + relative_humidity +\n    fire_spread_rate + fire_type + fuel_type + ia_access,\n  data = wildfire_clean,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\ntidy_model &lt;- tidy(model) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    estimate = round(estimate, 3),\n    std.error = round(std.error, 3),\n    statistic = round(statistic, 2),\n    p.value = round(p.value, 4)\n  )\n\nkable(tidy_model\n      , caption = \"Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\") |&gt;\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2.016\n0.401\n-5.03\n0.0000\n\n\ntemperature\n0.048\n0.010\n4.66\n0.0000\n\n\nwind_speed\n0.050\n0.004\n11.03\n0.0000\n\n\nrelative_humidity\n-0.031\n0.004\n-7.64\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_spread_rate\n0.104\n0.010\n10.30\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeGround\n-1.354\n0.184\n-7.37\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeSurface\n-1.093\n0.129\n-8.48\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeUnknown\n-13.012\n3683.753\n0.00\n0.9972\n\n\nfuel_typeC2\n-0.945\n0.175\n-5.40\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeC3\n-1.024\n0.276\n-3.71\n0.0002\n\n\nfuel_typeC4\n0.454\n0.337\n1.35\n0.1775\n\n\nfuel_typeC6\n-16.192\n4492.954\n0.00\n0.9971\n\n\nfuel_typeC7\n-16.211\n1258.218\n-0.01\n0.9897\n\n\nfuel_typeD1\n-16.322\n274.554\n-0.06\n0.9526\n\n\nfuel_typeM1\n-1.798\n0.362\n-4.97\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM2\n-2.272\n0.279\n-8.13\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM3\n-15.610\n3734.948\n0.00\n0.9967\n\n\nfuel_typeM4\n-15.179\n6522.639\n0.00\n0.9981\n\n\nfuel_typeO1a\n-2.912\n0.289\n-10.08\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeO1b\n-3.514\n0.456\n-7.70\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS1\n-2.189\n0.486\n-4.51\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS2\n-2.242\n0.546\n-4.11\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeUnknown\n-4.148\n0.481\n-8.62\n0.0000\n\n\nia_accessGround\n-0.861\n0.410\n-2.10\n0.0356\n\n\nia_accessHover Exit\n-0.083\n0.412\n-0.20\n0.8407\n\n\nia_accessRappel\n-14.797\n554.243\n-0.03\n0.9787\n\n\nia_accessUnknown\n0.428\n0.107\n3.99\n0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher wind speed (0.050, p &lt; 0.001), temperature (0.048, p &lt; 0.001), and fire spread rate (0.104, p &lt; 0.001) significantly increase the odds of a large wildfire, while relative humidity (-0.031, p &lt; 0.001) decreases it. Compared to crown fires, ground fires (-1.354, p &lt; 0.001) and surface fires (-1.093, p &lt; 0.001) are much less likely to result in large fires.\nThis logistic regression model estimates the factors influencing the likelihood of a large wildfire. Higher temperature, wind speed, and fire spread rate significantly increase the odds of a large fire, while higher relative humidity decreases it. Certain fire types (e.g., Ground, Surface) and fuel types (e.g., M1, M2, O1a, O1b) are associated with significantly lower odds compared to their respective reference categories. The model shows that higher wind speed, lower humidity, and faster fire spread significantly increase the risk of large wildfires.\nLet’s dig into our model further by examining how different environmental and operational factors interact to influence fire outcomes.\n\n\n4. Interpretation of our Model using marginaleffects\nThe Role of Wind Across Fire Causes\nAs you’ve likely noticed, we did not include true_cause as a predictor in our logistic regression model because it contains many categories, some of which have very few observations. This can lead to large standard errors, unstable coefficient estimates, and a higher risk of overfitting.\nHowever, true_cause remains an important variable for exploratory analysis. Certain ignition causes may be more sensitive to wind. For example, sparks from power lines can spread quickly in high winds, embers from debris burning can travel farther, and unattended fires can escalate rapidly under windy conditions. We chose wind speed for this analysis because it is a well-documented environmental amplifier of fire behavior particularly when interacting with certain ignition causes.\nGiven these interactions, it’s valuable to visualize and investigate how the effect of wind speed on large wild fire development varies across different causes. Let’s explore this further through faceted marginal effect plots.\nThis plot shows how wind speed affects the probability of a large wildfire, and how that effect varies across different true causes of fire.\n\nThe x-axis shows the different values of true_cause (fire ignition source categories).\nThe y-axis shows the marginal effect of wind speed on the predicted probability (i.e., on the response scale) of a fire becoming large.\n\nThe plot helps us compare the sensitivity of different fire causes to wind speed. For example, if one cause shows a higher marginal effect, it means that increasing wind speed has a stronger impact on the likelihood of large fires for that cause.\n\np &lt;- plot_comparisons(\n  model,\n  variables = \"wind_speed\",\n  by = \"true_cause\",\n  type = \"response\"\n)\n\np +\n  scale_color_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect of Wind Speed on Large Fire Probability by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Marginal Effect of Wind Speed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal effects analysis suggests that wind speed may have a relatively stronger impact on the probability of a fire becoming large when the ignition cause is related to Unknown, Insufficient Buffer, Incendiary Device, Hot Exhaust, or Line Impact. However, the overall changes in predicted probabilities are quite small, and the error bars across causes show substantial overlap. This indicates a high degree of uncertainty and suggests that these differences should be interpreted with caution. While the findings may not yet be strong enough to inform operational decisions, they do highlight areas for further exploration. In particular, when wind is forecasted in regions with a history of certain ignition causes, fire managers could use this exploratory insight to guide risk monitoring strategies, while recognizing that more robust evidence is needed before drawing firm conclusions.\nInteraction Effects via Marginal Effects\nWe can also use marginal effects to explore interactions without explicitly adding them to the model, by conditioning on another variable.\nThis plot shows the marginal effect of relative_humidity on the predicted probability of large fire, calculated separately for each level of fire_type, based on your fitted model.\n\nplot_comparisons(model, variables = \"relative_humidity\", by = \"fire_type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the marginal effect of relative humidity across fire types, we found that three fire types showed almost no change in large fire probability as humidity increased. However, one fire type exhibited a noticeably stronger negative effect. This suggests that humidity plays a more meaningful role in suppressing fire growth for certain fire types likely those that are more sensitive to moisture availability, such as crown fires—while having minimal effect on others.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis aimed to uncover the key environmental and operational factors associated with the development of large wildfires in Alberta. Using logistic regression and marginal effects, we modeled the probability of a wildfire exceeding 200 hectares, which is a meaningful operational threshold for fire managers.\nWe found that higher temperature, stronger wind speed, and faster spread rates significantly increase the likelihood of a large wildfire. Conversely, higher relative humidity consistently reduced fire size probability, highlighting its protective role in fire suppression.\nIn addition to main effects, we explored interaction patterns using marginal effects. While we did not include true_cause directly in the model due to its high cardinality and sparse categories, we used it in conjunction with wind_speed to explore how ignition causes might modulate wind’s influence on fire growth. The marginal effect plots suggest that certain causes—such as incendiary devices, line impacts, or insufficient buffer zones are more sensitive to wind speed, potentially due to the nature of how these fires spread under wind-driven conditions.\nSimilarly, by plotting the effect of relative_humidity across different fire_type categories, we observed that humidity suppresses large fire development more strongly in certain fire types, particularly crown fires. This implies that moisture-based mitigation strategies may be more effective in forests prone to crown fire behavior, while having less impact on surface or ground fires.\nWhile some observed differences in marginal effects were small in magnitude and had overlapping confidence intervals, these nuanced insights still provide value. They highlight where future research or localized fire management protocols could focus, especially under climate scenarios with increasing temperature and wind extremes.\nOverall, this case study illustrates how statistical modeling paired with domain-informed exploratory tools like marginal effects can support risk-informed, data-driven wildfire management."

    "section": "Case Study",
    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nWhat behavioral factors are strongly associated with relationship quality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? Are these factors different for same sex couples?\nThis case study examines the association between relationship_quality and a variety of behavioral and pandemic-related variables.\nBy examining survey data, we aim to:\n\nIdentify the behavioral factors that most strongly affect the perceived relationship quality. We will focus specifically on finding how sex_frequency, flirts_with_partner and fights_with_partner affect the perception of relationship quality and we are going to evaluate if these factors have a different impact on same sex couples (same_sex_couple).\nWe will also evaluate whether COVID-19 related factors such vaccination status (subject_vaccinated, partner_vaccinated), COVID-19 illness (subject_had_covid, partner_had_covid), income changes during the pandemic (inc_change_during_pandemic), and agreement on pandemic-related approaches (agree_covid_approach) affected couples’ perceived relationship quality.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nFirst, we need to load the libraries that will be used through the exercise, including the diversedata package.\n\nlibrary(diversedata)\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(brant)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\n1.

Variable Encoding\nWe can note that our categorical response follows a specific order. For this reason, we require a model that suits ordinal responses. Hence, we will be using an Ordinal Logistic regression model framework.\nIn order to do so, we need to make sure that our response variable is encoded as an ordered factor. We will also take this opportunity to encode our explanatory variables as factors (and ordered factors) as needed.\nFirst, we can encode our nominal categorical explanatory variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(same_sex_couple = as_factor(same_sex_couple)|&gt; \n           fct_recode(\"No\" = \"no\", \"Yes\" = \"yes\"))\n\nlevels(hcmst$same_sex_couple)\n\n[1] \"No\"  \"Yes\"\n\n\nThen, we can encode all our ordinal, categorical, explanatory, behavioral variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = as.ordered(sex_frequency)) |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = fct_relevel(sex_frequency, \n      c(\"once_a_month_or_less\", \"2_to_3_times_a_month\", \n        \"once_or_twice_a_week\", \"3_to_6_times_a_week\", \n        \"once_or_more_a_day\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(flirts_with_partner = as.ordered(flirts_with_partner)) |&gt; \n  mutate(flirts_with_partner = fct_relevel(flirts_with_partner, \n      c(\"never\", \"less_than_once_a_month\", \n        \"1_to_3_times_a_month\", \"once_a_week\", \n        \"a_few_times_a_week\", \"every_day\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$flirts_with_partner)\n\n[1] \"never\"                  \"less_than_once_a_month\" \"1_to_3_times_a_month\"  \n[4] \"once_a_week\"            \"a_few_times_a_week\"     \"every_day\"             \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(fights_with_partner = as.ordered(fights_with_partner)) |&gt; \n  mutate(fights_with_partner = fct_relevel(fights_with_partner, \n      c(\"0_times\", \"1_time\", \"2_times\", \"3_times\", \"4_times\", \n        \"5_times\", \"6_times\", \"7_or_more_times\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\n\nThen, we can encode all our ordinal, categorical, explanatory, COVID-19-related variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(inc_change_during_pandemic = as.ordered(inc_change_during_pandemic)) |&gt; \n  mutate(inc_change_during_pandemic = fct_relevel(inc_change_during_pandemic, \n      c(\"much_worse\", \"worse\", \"no_change\", \"better\", \"much_better\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$inc_change_during_pandemic)\n\n[1] \"much_worse\"  \"worse\"       \"no_change\"   \"better\"      \"much_better\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(subject_had_covid = as_factor(subject_had_covid))\n\nlevels(hcmst$subject_had_covid)\n\n[1] \"no\"  \"yes\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(partner_had_covid = as_factor(partner_had_covid))\n\nlevels(hcmst$partner_had_covid)\n\n[1] \"yes\" \"no\" \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(subject_vaccinated = as.ordered(subject_vaccinated)) |&gt; \n  mutate(subject_vaccinated = fct_relevel(subject_vaccinated, \n      c(\"not_vaccinated\", \"partially_vaccinated\", \n        \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\", \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$subject_vaccinated)\n\n[1] \"not_vaccinated\"               \"partially_vaccinated\"        \n[3] \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\"  \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(partner_vaccinated = as.ordered(partner_vaccinated)) |&gt; \n  mutate(partner_vaccinated = fct_relevel(partner_vaccinated, \n      c(\"not_vaccinated\", \"partially_vaccinated\", \n        \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\", \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$partner_vaccinated)\n\n[1] \"not_vaccinated\"               \"partially_vaccinated\"        \n[3] \"fully_vaccinated_no_booster\"  \"fully_vaccinated_and_booster\"\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(agree_covid_approach = as.ordered(agree_covid_approach)) |&gt; \n  mutate(agree_covid_approach = fct_relevel(agree_covid_approach, \n      c(\"completely_disagree\", \"mostly_disagree\", \n        \"mostly_agree\", \"completely_agree\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$agree_covid_approach)\n\n[1] \"completely_disagree\" \"mostly_disagree\"     \"mostly_agree\"       \n[4] \"completely_agree\"   \n\n\nFinally, we can encode our target variable:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(relationship_quality = as.ordered(relationship_quality)) |&gt; \n  mutate(relationship_quality = fct_relevel(relationship_quality, \n      c(\"very_poor\", \"poor\", \"fair\", \"good\", \"excellent\")))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\n\n\n\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe will visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables. But first, we will see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\n\n# We'll use a color blind friendly pallete:\ncbPalette &lt;- c(\"#0072B2\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#999999\", \"#E69F00\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\nggplot(hcmst, aes(x = same_sex_couple, fill = same_sex_couple)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Couple Type Distribution\",\n    x = \"Same Sex Couple\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Same Sex Couple\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, by = 100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is smaller that that of different-sex couples.

However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency. We can also visualize how often couples flirt with or fight with their partners. The distribution of responses shows a tendency toward lower frequencies of both flirting and fighting.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be noted that most subjects had no change in income during the pandemic, did not have COVID, were fully vaccinated including the booster shot, and completely agreed with their partners in terms of their approach to the pandemic.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Model Fitting and Assumptions\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables, as well as COVID-19 related variables, affect the perception of relationship quality. Additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same sex couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + \n    sex_frequency + \n    flirts_with_partner + \n    fights_with_partner + \n    inc_change_during_pandemic + \n    subject_had_covid + \n    partner_had_covid + \n    subject_vaccinated + \n    partner_vaccinated + \n    agree_covid_approach,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption.

These are due to instances where combinations of the response variable and predictor levels have no observations. One warning from the Brant test indicates that over 3,000,000 combinations of the dependent variable (dv) and independent variables (ivs) are not present in the data set.\nWhen models include multiple categorical predictors with many levels, the number of possible combinations of predictors and outcomes grows exponentially. In real-world survey data, especially from large data sets, many of these combinations are either extremely rare or entirely missing. This sparsity can compromise the reliability of the Brant test, which assumes sufficient data within each combination to estimate parameters.\nOne potential solution is to bin levels of categorical variables that have low counts, reducing the number of empty combinations. However, when there are many predictors with multiple levels, even binning may not fully resolve the issue.\nThis limitation is common in multivariable modeling and reflects constraints in data collection and the inherent sparsity of data. As such, the results from diagnostics like the Brant test should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n5.

Prediction\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on behavioral and COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject. Focusing on the levels that were associated with statistically significant factors:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"Yes\",\n  sex_frequency = \"once_a_month_or_less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"a_few_times_a_week\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"1_time\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"worse\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"no\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"no\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"not_vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"not_vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"mostly_disagree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.08      0.32      0.41      0.17      0.02 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"No\",\n  sex_frequency = \"2_to_3_times_a_month\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"every_day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"0_times\",\n  inc_change_during_pandemic = \"no_change\",\n  subject_had_covid = \"no\",\n  partner_had_covid = \"no\", \n  subject_vaccinated = \"not_vaccinated\", \n  partner_vaccinated = \"partially_vaccinated\",\n  agree_covid_approach = \"mostly_agree\"\n  ), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.02      0.20      0.78 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a same-sex couple, who has sex once a month or less, flirts with their partner a few times a week, fought with their partner once in the last week, experienced worsened income during the pandemic, is not vaccinated (nor is their partner), and mostly disagrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 41% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair.\nOn the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex two or three times a month, flirts with their partner on a daily basis, has not fought with their partner in the last week, experienced no change in income during the pandemic, has a partially vaccinated partner, and mostly agrees with their partner’s approach to COVID, has a 78% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how relationship habits, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to perceived relationship quality across different types of couples. Through the analysis, results highlight that relationship behaviors and shared beliefs meaningfully affect how individuals evaluate their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively.\nShared beliefs are beneficial: Agreement with a partner’s approach to COVID-19 was a very strong predictor of relationship quality. Moving in a direction of agreement had a significant positive association.\nExternal factors play a role as well: Financial stability during the pandemic, as well as the partner’s vaccination status were also linked to better relationship quality, suggesting that alignment on external factors, such as health and financial concerns, could cause stress in couple dynamics contribute to positive perceptions.\nPerceived relationship quality varied by couple type: Individuals in same-sex couples, on average, reported slightly lower relationship quality compared to those in different-sex couples. Although this difference was modest, it was statistically significant, which may warrant a need for further exploration into the factors that may influence these perceptions.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models. Also, encoding categorical predictors must be done with care to ensure meaningful and interpretable contrasts.\nSparsity may affect results: When categorical variables have many levels, certain combinations of predictors may be underrepresented. This sparsity may impact the model and its assumptions, so caution is advised when drawing conclusions from underpopulated subgroups."

    "text": "Case Study\n\nObjective\nWhich variables in the data set contain missing values, and how can we handle them appropriately to ensure a complete and unbiased analysis?\nThis case study explores patterns of missing data in a global LGBTQ+ rights data set that includes economic and legal indicators such as GDP per capita, education spending. Using a variety of visualization tools, we aim to identify where and how missing values occur across different variables.\nRather than ignoring or arbitrarily removing incomplete data, we apply imputation techniques to fill missing values.\n\n\nAnalysis\nLoading Libraries\n\n# Data\nlibrary(diversedata)      # Diverse Data Hub data set\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(VIM)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(mice)\n\n\n1.

Aggregation Plots\nThe first fundamental question to ask is: which variables contain missing values, and how many observations are affected? Aggregation plots are a useful tool to quickly summarize and visualize the extent of missingness across all variables in the data set.\nPlease note that :\n\nEach row in the plot represents a unique pattern of missingness across your variables. For example, one row might show only gdp-per-capita is missing and another might show edu_spend and employment are missing together.\nThe height of each bar on the left indicates the number (or percentage) of rows in our data that match that missing pattern.\n\n\n# Visualize missing values across all variables\ninvisible(\n  capture.output(\n    aggr(\n      cleaned_rights,\n      numbers = TRUE,\n      prop = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n      sortVars = TRUE,\n      cex.axis = 0.5,\n      las = 2,  # vertical labels\n      gap = 2,\n      col = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\"),\n      ylab = c(\"Missing Data (%)\", \"Missing Data Pattern\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aggregation plot provides a clear overview of missingness across variables in the data set. From this visualization, it is evident that several categorical variables particularly lgbtq-censorship, employment, and affirming-care contain substantial amounts of missing data. Among the continuous variables, education spending (edu-spend) stands out as having more missing values than gdp-per-capita, which may reflect inconsistencies in government reporting or data availability across countries. Many variables in this data set have missing values, so handling missing data is an important step in preparing the data.\nGiven the extent of missing data observed in the aggregation plot, we will take a closer look at selected variables to better understand the underlying patterns of missingness. Specifically, we focus on the following variables:\n\ngdp-per-capita and edu-spend, as key continuous indicators of national economic and educational investment. These variables are central to many of the analyses in this data set and missingness here may influence statistical outcomes if not properly addressed.\nsame-sex-marriage represents a key dimension of legal recognition for LGBTQ+ individuals. This categorical variable shows substantial missingness, which may reflect patterns tied to reporting practices or regional legal disparities in the recognition of same-sex unions. It includes seven categories that capture the varying legal statuses across countries: Banned, Civil union or other partnership, Unrecognized, Unregistered cohabitation, Legal, Varies by region, and Foreign same-sex marriages recognized only.\n\n\n\n3. Spinogram and Spineplot\nSo far, we have gained a high-level overview of missingness across the data set. To dig deeper, we now examine how missing values in one variable relate to the categories of another. This helps us understand whether missingness may be random or related to other features in the data.\nThe function spineMiss() from the {VIM} package is used for this purpose. It produces a spineplot, a type of bar chart that visualizes the distribution of missing vs. non-missing values in a variable (in this case, gdp) across the levels of a categorical variable (in this case, same-sex-marriage).\nBy running spineMiss(cleaned_rights[, c(\"marriage\", \"gdp\")]), we create a plot that shows, for each category of same-sex marriage recognition (e.g., Legal, Civil Union, Not Recognized), the proportion of observations where GDP is missing versus observed.\nThis visualization allows us to assess whether missing GDP values are evenly distributed across marriage groups (which might suggest MCAR: Missing Completely at Random), or if they are more prevalent in certain categories (which could suggest MAR: Missing at Random). It’s a helpful diagnostic tool to explore whether the missingness in gdp-per-capita is associated with legal recognition of same-sex marriage, which is crucial before deciding how to impute or model the data.\nPlease note that, based on Flexible Imputation of Missing Data by Stef van Buuren (2018), you can find the definitions as follows:\n\nMCAR (Missing Completely at Random): The probability of missingness is unrelated to any observed or unobserved data. In other words, missing data occur entirely at random.\nMAR (Missing at Random): The probability of missingness may depend on observed data but not on the missing values themselves. For example, GDP might be missing more often in countries without same-sex marriage laws, but not because of the GDP value itself.\nMNAR (Missing Not at Random): The probability of missingness depends on the value of the missing data itself. For example, countries with very low GDP might be less likely to report it.\n\n\n# Visualize missingness in GDP per capita across legal gender categories\npar(mar = c(10, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)\nspineMiss(cleaned_rights[, c(\"same_sex_marriage\", \"gdp_per_capita\")],\n          col = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\"),\n          cex.axis = 0.7,         \n          las = 2,                \n          xlab = \"Same Sex Marriage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spine plot shows that missing values in gdp-per-capita are not distributed evenly across the levels of same-sex-marriage recognition. Between seven categories, missingness is most frequent in countries where same-sex marriages are Unrecognized, followed by those where same-sex marriage is Banned, and then in countries where it is Legal.\nThis pattern suggests that the missingness in GDP is likely not completely at random, and may be associated with marriage recognition status, indicating a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism. Recognizing this pattern is important, as it can guide the selection of appropriate imputation strategies that account for such relationships.\n\n# Visualize missingness in education spending across legal gender categories\npar(mar = c(10, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)\nspineMiss(cleaned_rights[, c(\"same_sex_marriage\", \"edu_spend\")],\n          col = c(\"gray85\", \"skyblue\"),\n          cex.axis = 0.7,         \n          las = 2,                \n          xlab = \"Same Sex Marriage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spine plot for edu-spend across same-sex-marriage categories reveals that missing values are present in all levels of marriage recognition, unlike gdp, where missingness was more concentrated. Again between seven categories, missingness is most frequent in countries where same-sex marriages are Unrecognized, followed by those where same-sex marriage is Banned, and then in countries where it is Legal. We can also see that the Civil union or other partnership category has missing values\nThis widespread but uneven distribution suggests that the missingness in education spending is likely not completely at random (MCAR). Instead, it may be Missing At Random (MAR), as the probability of missing values appears to vary with observed levels of legal recognition. This pattern underscores the importance of considering contextual legal factors when handling missing values for edu-spend, as they may be informative and should influence imputation choices.\n\n\n4. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) using PMM\nWe used MICE with predictive mean matching (PMM) because it is well-suited to data sets with multiple partially missing variables, allows for realistic value imputation, and accommodates the MAR mechanism observed in o\nThrough earlier visualizations (like spineMiss and mosaicMiss), we observed that the missing values in gdp and edu_spend depend on other variables (e.g., marriage status). This suggests the data are Missing at Random (MAR) where imputation models should account for relationships between variables.\nWe used Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) to impute missing values in continuous variables like GDP and education spending. This method ensures that the imputed values are realistic and drawn from the actual data distribution, avoiding extreme or implausible results like negative GDP. Because these variables are often skewed, PMM offers a more robust alternative to linear regression.\nTo handle multiple variables with missing values, we applied the MICE algorithm, which builds a separate model for each incomplete variable using relevant predictors like marriage status, employment protection, and legal gender. This approach allows for flexible and iterative imputation, especially effective when missingness is spread across several variables.\nFinally, MICE generates multiple imputed data sets, which supports transparent and reproducible analysis while accounting for uncertainty in the missing data.\n\nimpute_df &lt;- cleaned_rights |&gt;\n  select(gdp_per_capita, edu_spend, same_sex_marriage, lgbtq_censorship, employment, affirming_care, legal_gender)\n\nimpute_df &lt;- impute_df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    marriage = as.factor(same_sex_marriage),\n    censorship = as.factor(lgbtq_censorship),\n    employment = as.factor(employment),\n    affirming_care = as.factor(affirming_care),\n    legal_gender = as.factor(legal_gender)\n  )\n\nset.seed(123)\nimputed &lt;- mice(impute_df, method = \"pmm\", m = 5)\n\n\n iter imp variable\n  1   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  1   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  2   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  3   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  4   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   1  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   2  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   3  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   4  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n  5   5  gdp_per_capita  edu_spend  employment  affirming_care  legal_gender  marriage  censorship\n\n\n\n\n5.

In this case study, we addressed missingness in both variables using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) with Predictive Mean Matching (PMM).\nBy including categorical predictors such as legal gender recognition, employment protection, marriage equality, and censorship laws, we aimed to generate imputations that reflect realistic values consistent with each country’s broader policy environment. The use of PMM ensured that imputed values were drawn from observed data points, preserving the original distribution and avoiding implausible values (e.g., negative GDP or unrealistic education spending).\nWe imputed both variables simultaneously within the same model, allowing the algorithm to borrow strength across variables and iterations. This approach reflects a more robust and context-aware method than imputing variables separately or using simple strategies like mean substitution.\nComparing the density plots of the original and imputed data revealed that the imputed values align well with the observed data distribution, suggesting that the imputations are not introducing substantial bias. This strengthens the reliability of subsequent statistical analyses such as ANOVA, regression modeling, or equity comparisons that rely on complete data sets.\nHowever, there are some limitations to consider. While MICE with PMM preserves distributional properties, it still assumes that the data are missing at random (MAR), which may not hold true in all contexts particularly when data availability is tied to political or economic instability. Moreover, the inclusion of policy indicators as predictors helps contextualize imputations but may also introduce circular reasoning if those same indicators are later used as outcomes in analysis. Future work could explore sensitivity analyses to assess how different imputation models affect results or incorporate external data sources to validate imputed values. Addressing these limitations would further strengthen the robustness and credibility of equity-focused policy research."

Understanding the patterns of wildfire occurrence and spread helps policymakers, environmental planners, and emergency services allocate resources more equitably and implement effective mitigation strategies. This data set enables data-driven approaches to reduce the impact of wildfires and support more resilient and inclusive disaster management practices across Alberta and beyond.\n\n\n\n Download CSV \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV Name\n\n\nwildfire.csv\n\n\nData Set Characteristics\n\n\nMultivariate\n\n\nSubject Area\n\n\nClimate Change\n\n\nAssociated Tasks\n\n\nClassification, Time Series, Geospatial Analysis\n\n\nFeature Type\n\n\nCategorical, Integer\n\n\nInstances\n\n\n26551 records\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n50\n\n\nHas Missing Values?\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nRole\nType\nDescription\nUnits\nMissing Values\n\n\n\n\nyear\nID\nInteger\nYear of the wildfire. incident\nYear\nNo\n\n\nfire_number\nID\nString\nUnique identifier for each wildfire\n-\nNo\n\n\ncurrent_size\nFeature\nNumeric\nFinal estimated size of the wildfire\nHectares\nNo\n\n\nsize_class\nFeature\nCategorical\nSize classification based on fire area\n-\nNo\n\n\nlatitude\nFeature\nNumeric\nLatitude coordinate of fire origin\nDegrees\nNo\n\n\nlongitude\nFeature\nNumeric\nLongitude coordinate of fire origin\nDegrees\nNo\n\n\nfire_origin\nMetadata\nCategorical\nGeneral location or region where fire started\n-\nNo\n\n\ngeneral_cause\nFeature\nCategorical\nBroad cause classification of the fire\n-\nYes\n\n\nresponsible_group\nMetadata\nCategorical\nAgency or group responsible for managing the fire\n-\nYes\n\n\nactivity_class\nFeature\nCategorical\nActivity classification at the time of ignition\n-\nYes\n\n\ntrue_cause\nFeature\nCategorical\nDetailed fire cause (e.g., Arson Known, Hot Exhaust, Line Impact, Unattended Fire, etc.)\n-\nNo\n\n\nfire_start_date\nTime\nDate\nDate the fire started\nYYYY-MM-DD\nNo\n\n\ndetection_agent_type\nFeature\nCategorical\nType of detection method used (e.g., lookout, patrol, aircraft)\n-\nNo\n\n\ndetection_agent\nFeature\nCategorical\nSpecific agent who detected the fire\n-\nYes\n\n\nassessment_hectares\nFeature\nNumeric\nOfficially assessed size of the fire\nHectares\nNo\n\n\nfire_spread_rate\nFeature\nNumeric\nRate at which the fire spread\nHectares/hour\nYes\n\n\nfire_type\nFeature\nCategorical\nFire behavior classification (e.g., surface, crown, ground)\n-\nNo\n\n\nfire_position_on_slope\nFeature\nCategorical\nPosition of the fire on slope (e.g., bottom, mid-slope, ridge)\n-\nYes\n\n\nweather_conditions_over_fire\nFeature\nText\nDescription of weather at the fire location\n-\nYes\n\n\ntemperature\nFeature\nNumeric\nTemperature at the fire location\n°C\nYes\n\n\nrelative_humidity\nFeature\nNumeric\nRelative humidity at the fire location\n%\nYes\n\n\nwind_direction\nFeature\nCategorical\nWind direction during the fire\n-\nYes\n\n\nwind_speed\nFeature\nNumeric\nWind speed during the fire\nkm/h\nYes\n\n\nfuel_type\nFeature\nCategorical\nDominant vegetation or material burned (e.g., grass, timber)\n-\nYes\n\n\ninitial_action_by\nMetadata\nCategorical\nGroup that initiated suppression efforts\n-\nYes\n\n\nia_arrival_at_fire_date\nTime\nDateTime\nTime when initial action crews arrived\nYYYY-MM-DD\nYes\n\n\nia_access\nFeature\nCategorical\nLevel of access for initial attack teams (e.g., road, helicopter only)\n-\nYes\n\n\nfire_fighting_start_date\nTime\nDateTime\nTime when firefighting activities officially started\nYYYY-MM-DD\nYes\n\n\nfire_fighting_start_size\nFeature\nNumeric\nFire size at the time firefighting began\nHectares\nYes\n\n\nbucketing_on_fire\nFeature\nBinary\nWhether aerial bucketing was used on the fire\nYes/No\nYes\n\n\nfirst_bh_date\nTime\nDateTime\nDate of first blackline containment\nYYYY-MM-DD\nYes\n\n\nfirst_bh_size\nFeature\nNumeric\nFire size at time of first blacklining\nHectares\nYes\n\n\nfirst_uc_date\nTime\nDateTime\nDate when fire was first declared under control\nYYYY-MM-DD\nYes\n\n\nfirst_uc_size\nFeature\nNumeric\nFire size when first declared under control\nHectares\nYes\n\n\nfirst_ex_size_perimeter\nFeature\nNumeric\nEstimated fire perimeter at the time of first extinguishment\nKilometers\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach row represents a single wildfire incident and includes information such as:\n\ntemperature – The recorded air temperature (°C) at or near the fire location;

Identifying the key environmental and human factors linked to these fires can help guide more effective prevention and response strategies.\nSo, our main question is:\nCan we identify the environmental and human factors most associated with large wildfires?\nAccording to Natural Resources Canada, wildfires exceeding 200 hectares in final size are classified as “large fires.” While these fires represent a small percentage of all wildfires, they account for the majority of the total area burned annually.\nThe goal is to explore potential predictors of fire size, such as weather, fire cause, and detection method, and provide insights that could inform early interventions and resource planning.\n\n\nAnalysis\nLoading Libraries\n\n# Data\nlibrary(diversedata)      # Diverse Data Hub data sets\n\n# Core libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)        \nlibrary(lubridate)      \n\n# Spatial & mapping\nlibrary(sf)               \nlibrary(terra)            \nlibrary(ggmap)            \nlibrary(ggspatial)        \nlibrary(maptiles)         \nlibrary(leaflet)          \nlibrary(leaflet.extras)   \n\n# Visualization & color\nlibrary(viridis)          \n\n# Tables & reporting\nlibrary(gt)               \nlibrary(kableExtra)       \n\n# Modeling & interpretation\nlibrary(marginaleffects)  \nlibrary(broom)           \n\n\n1.

Exploratory Data Analysis\nMap of Wildfire Size and Location in Alberta\nThis interactive map displays the geographic distribution and relative size of wildfires across Alberta, using red circles sized by fire area. Each point represents a wildfire event, with larger circles indicating more extensive burns. The map reveals regions with concentrated wildfire activity and visually emphasizes differences in fire magnitude across the province.\n\nNote\nTo provide geographic context for our wildfire data, we added a shapefile representing Alberta’s boundaries.\nThis shapefile was sourced from the Alberta Government Open Data Portal and specifically corresponds to the Electoral Division Shapefile (Bill 33, 2017).\nThe data was processed and transformed to the appropriate geographic coordinate system to enable mapping alongside our wildfire data set.\n\n\n# map\nleaflet() |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"CartoDB.Positron\") |&gt; \n  setView(lng = -115, lat = 55, zoom = 5.5) |&gt; \n  addPolygons(data = alberta_shape, \n              color = \"#CCCCCC\",     \n              weight = 0.5,         \n              fillOpacity = 0.02,   \n              group = \"Alberta Boundaries\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(data = wildfire_sf,\n             radius = ~sqrt(current_size) * 30,  \n             fillOpacity = 0.6,\n             color = \"red\",\n             stroke = FALSE,\n             group = \"Wildfires\") |&gt;\n  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c(\"Alberta Boundaries\", \"Wildfires\"),\n                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) |&gt;\n  addLegend(position = \"bottomright\", \n            title = \"Wildfire Size (approx.)\",\n            colors = \"red\", \n            labels = \"Larger = Bigger fire\")\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of Large Fires by Cause\n\nwildfire_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(true_cause) |&gt;\n  summarize(prop_large = mean(large_fire, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  filter(prop_large &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(true_cause, prop_large), y = prop_large, fill = prop_large)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"skyblue1\", high = \"skyblue4\") +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Large Fires by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Fires &gt; 200 ha\",\n    fill = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Logistic Regression Model\nGovernments and emergency planners often care about whether a fire becomes large, not necessarily exactly how large. This makes a binary classification more interpretable and actionable for planning responses. Logistic regression predicts probability of exceeding a threshold, such as “Will this fire exceed 200 hectares?” Modeling the probability of exceeding such a threshold is often more operationally useful than modeling exact hectares.\nIn Decision Making for Wildfires: A Guide for Applying a Risk Management Process at the Incident Level, the authors outline a risk-based decision-making framework. A key concept is identifying risk thresholds to guide decisions. This aligns with the broader goals of wildfire risk management, which emphasize anticipating fire severity and planning appropriate responses. Logistic regression is well-suited to this context because it models the probability of crossing such thresholds, such as a fire becoming large, enabling a clear, interpretable basis for making timely, risk-informed decisions.\nWe built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a fire becoming large based on a set of environmental and operational factors that are consistently measurable, statistically significant, and operationally relevant.\nIn our logistic regression model, we selected key environmental and contextual variables from the wildfire_clean data set that are well-established drivers of wildfire behavior. These include:\n\ntemperature: Higher temperatures increase evaporation, dry out vegetation, and promote ignition and fire spread.\nwind_speed: Strong winds feed oxygen to the fire and can carry embers over long distances, accelerating spread.\nrelative_humidity: Low humidity conditions dry fuels, increasing the probability and intensity of fire ignition.\nfire_spread_rate: Reflects how quickly a fire expands; a dynamic indicator of fire behavior.\nfire_type: Indicates how the fire behaves (e.g., surface vs. crown fire), which affects controllability and risk.\nfuel_type: Different vegetation types burn at different intensities and rates; fuels like grass or timber respond differently under the same conditions.\nia_access: Stands for Initial Attack Access. Limited access can delay suppression efforts, allowing fires to grow larger.\n\nThese variables were chosen because they each represent core determinants of ignition likelihood, fire intensity, and suppression difficulty. As explained in Introduction to Wildland Fire by Pyne, Andrews, and Laven, this theoretical foundation supports our inclusion of both meteorological and environmental variables in the model.\nMathematical Definition of the Logistic Regression Model\nWe aim to estimate the probability that a wildfire becomes large (i.e., burns more than 200 hectares), using logistic regression.\nLet:\n\\[\nY_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if fire } i \\text{ is large (area &gt; 200 ha)} \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_i =\n\\left(\n\\text{temperature}_i,\n\\text{wind\\_speed}_i,\n\\text{relative\\_humidity}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i,\n\\text{fire\\_type}_i,\n\\text{fuel\\_type}_i,\n\\text{ia\\_access}_i\n\\right)\n\\]\nThen the model is defined as:\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta_i)}\n\\]\nwhere the linear predictor is:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0\n+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{temperature}_i\n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{wind\\_speed}_i\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{relative\\_humidity}_i\n+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{fire\\_spread\\_rate}_i\n+ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}}\n\\]\nHere:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_0 & \\text{ is the intercept} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of coefficients for the categorical predictors} \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\text{cat}} & \\text{ is the vector of dummy variables representing those categorical predictors}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nmodel &lt;- glm(\n  large_fire ~ temperature + wind_speed + relative_humidity +\n    fire_spread_rate + fire_type + fuel_type + ia_access,\n  data = wildfire_clean,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\ntidy_model &lt;- tidy(model) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    estimate = round(estimate, 3),\n    std.error = round(std.error, 3),\n    statistic = round(statistic, 2),\n    p.value = round(p.value, 4)\n  )\n\nkable(tidy_model\n      , caption = \"Logistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\") |&gt;\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Results: Predicting Large Fires (&gt; 200 ha)\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2.016\n0.401\n-5.03\n0.0000\n\n\ntemperature\n0.048\n0.010\n4.66\n0.0000\n\n\nwind_speed\n0.050\n0.004\n11.03\n0.0000\n\n\nrelative_humidity\n-0.031\n0.004\n-7.64\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_spread_rate\n0.104\n0.010\n10.30\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeGround\n-1.354\n0.184\n-7.37\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeSurface\n-1.093\n0.129\n-8.48\n0.0000\n\n\nfire_typeUnknown\n-13.012\n3683.753\n0.00\n0.9972\n\n\nfuel_typeC2\n-0.945\n0.175\n-5.40\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeC3\n-1.024\n0.276\n-3.71\n0.0002\n\n\nfuel_typeC4\n0.454\n0.337\n1.35\n0.1775\n\n\nfuel_typeC6\n-16.192\n4492.954\n0.00\n0.9971\n\n\nfuel_typeC7\n-16.211\n1258.218\n-0.01\n0.9897\n\n\nfuel_typeD1\n-16.322\n274.554\n-0.06\n0.9526\n\n\nfuel_typeM1\n-1.798\n0.362\n-4.97\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM2\n-2.272\n0.279\n-8.13\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeM3\n-15.610\n3734.948\n0.00\n0.9967\n\n\nfuel_typeM4\n-15.179\n6522.639\n0.00\n0.9981\n\n\nfuel_typeO1a\n-2.912\n0.289\n-10.08\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeO1b\n-3.514\n0.456\n-7.70\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS1\n-2.189\n0.486\n-4.51\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeS2\n-2.242\n0.546\n-4.11\n0.0000\n\n\nfuel_typeUnknown\n-4.148\n0.481\n-8.62\n0.0000\n\n\nia_accessGround\n-0.861\n0.410\n-2.10\n0.0356\n\n\nia_accessHover Exit\n-0.083\n0.412\n-0.20\n0.8407\n\n\nia_accessRappel\n-14.797\n554.243\n-0.03\n0.9787\n\n\nia_accessUnknown\n0.428\n0.107\n3.99\n0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher wind speed (0.050, p &lt; 0.001), temperature (0.048, p &lt; 0.001), and fire spread rate (0.104, p &lt; 0.001) significantly increase the odds of a large wildfire, while relative humidity (-0.031, p &lt; 0.001) decreases it. Compared to crown fires, ground fires (-1.354, p &lt; 0.001) and surface fires (-1.093, p &lt; 0.001) are much less likely to result in large fires.\nThis logistic regression model estimates the factors influencing the likelihood of a large wildfire. Higher temperature, wind speed, and fire spread rate significantly increase the odds of a large fire, while higher relative humidity decreases it. Certain fire types (e.g., Ground, Surface) and fuel types (e.g., M1, M2, O1a, O1b) are associated with significantly lower odds compared to their respective reference categories. The model shows that higher wind speed, lower humidity, and faster fire spread significantly increase the risk of large wildfires.\nLet’s dig into our model further by examining how different environmental and operational factors interact to influence fire outcomes.\n\n\n4. Interpretation of our Model using marginaleffects\nThe Role of Wind Across Fire Causes\nAs you’ve likely noticed, we did not include true_cause as a predictor in our logistic regression model because it contains many categories, some of which have very few observations. This can lead to large standard errors, unstable coefficient estimates, and a higher risk of overfitting.\nHowever, true_cause remains an important variable for exploratory analysis. Certain ignition causes may be more sensitive to wind. For example, sparks from power lines can spread quickly in high winds, embers from debris burning can travel farther, and unattended fires can escalate rapidly under windy conditions. We chose wind speed for this analysis because it is a well-documented environmental amplifier of fire behavior particularly when interacting with certain ignition causes.\nGiven these interactions, it’s valuable to visualize and investigate how the effect of wind speed on large wild fire development varies across different causes. Let’s explore this further through faceted marginal effect plots.\nThis plot shows how wind speed affects the probability of a large wildfire, and how that effect varies across different true causes of fire.\n\nThe x-axis shows the different values of true_cause (fire ignition source categories).\nThe y-axis shows the marginal effect of wind speed on the predicted probability (i.e., on the response scale) of a fire becoming large.\n\nThe plot helps us compare the sensitivity of different fire causes to wind speed. For example, if one cause shows a higher marginal effect, it means that increasing wind speed has a stronger impact on the likelihood of large fires for that cause.\n\np &lt;- plot_comparisons(\n  model,\n  variables = \"wind_speed\",\n  by = \"true_cause\",\n  type = \"response\"\n)\n\np +\n  scale_color_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = rep(\"darkgreen\", length(unique(p$data$by)))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect of Wind Speed on Large Fire Probability by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Marginal Effect of Wind Speed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal effects analysis suggests that wind speed may have a relatively stronger impact on the probability of a fire becoming large when the ignition cause is related to Unknown, Insufficient Buffer, Incendiary Device, Hot Exhaust, or Line Impact. However, the overall changes in predicted probabilities are quite small, and the error bars across causes show substantial overlap. This indicates a high degree of uncertainty and suggests that these differences should be interpreted with caution. While the findings may not yet be strong enough to inform operational decisions, they do highlight areas for further exploration. In particular, when wind is forecasted in regions with a history of certain ignition causes, fire managers could use this exploratory insight to guide risk monitoring strategies, while recognizing that more robust evidence is needed before drawing firm conclusions.\nInteraction Effects via Marginal Effects\nWe can also use marginal effects to explore interactions without explicitly adding them to the model, by conditioning on another variable.\nThis plot shows the marginal effect of relative_humidity on the predicted probability of large fire, calculated separately for each level of fire_type, based on your fitted model.\n\nplot_comparisons(model, variables = \"relative_humidity\", by = \"fire_type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the marginal effect of relative humidity across fire types, we found that three fire types showed almost no change in large fire probability as humidity increased. However, one fire type exhibited a noticeably stronger negative effect. This suggests that humidity plays a more meaningful role in suppressing fire growth for certain fire types likely those that are more sensitive to moisture availability, such as crown fires—while having minimal effect on others.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis aimed to uncover the key environmental and operational factors associated with the development of large wildfires in Alberta. Using logistic regression and marginal effects, we modeled the probability of a wildfire exceeding 200 hectares, which is a meaningful operational threshold for fire managers.\nWe found that higher temperature, stronger wind speed, and faster spread rates significantly increase the likelihood of a large wildfire. Conversely, higher relative humidity consistently reduced fire size probability, highlighting its protective role in fire suppression.\nIn addition to main effects, we explored interaction patterns using marginal effects. While we did not include true_cause directly in the model due to its high cardinality and sparse categories, we used it in conjunction with wind_speed to explore how ignition causes might modulate wind’s influence on fire growth. The marginal effect plots suggest that certain causes—such as incendiary devices, line impacts, or insufficient buffer zones are more sensitive to wind speed, potentially due to the nature of how these fires spread under wind-driven conditions.\nSimilarly, by plotting the effect of relative_humidity across different fire_type categories, we observed that humidity suppresses large fire development more strongly in certain fire types, particularly crown fires. This implies that moisture-based mitigation strategies may be more effective in forests prone to crown fire behavior, while having less impact on surface or ground fires.\nWhile some observed differences in marginal effects were small in magnitude and had overlapping confidence intervals, these nuanced insights still provide value. They highlight where future research or localized fire management protocols could focus, especially under climate scenarios with increasing temperature and wind extremes.\nOverall, this case study illustrates how statistical modeling paired with domain-informed exploratory tools like marginal effects can support risk-informed, data-driven wildfire management."
