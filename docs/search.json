Discussion\nThe logistic regression model revealed that higher wind speeds are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of a fire becoming large (over 10 hectares), consistent with our expectations about fire spread dynamics.\nSurprisingly, temperature showed a small negative association with fire size, though this may be influenced by interactions with other environmental factors like humidity or fuel type.\nAmong causes, “Insufficient Resources” and “Line Impact” were associated with significantly higher odds of large fires. This suggests that both human-related limitations and infrastructure vulnerability (like power lines) play a role in fire escalation.\nThe detection agent type showed weak evidence that fires detected by UNP agents may be less likely to become large, compared to FPD Staff, but the effect was not statistically strong (p = 0.09). Further exploration is needed here, especially considering the early intervention ability of different detection teams.\nThese findings provide insights into key environmental and operational factors influencing wildfire severity. Importantly, they point to the need for targeted mitigation strategies in areas with poor detection access or high infrastructure risks.\nIn the broader context of equity, this analysis reinforces that resource constraints and delayed detection—often more common in remote or underfunded regions—can amplify wildfire impacts. Data-informed strategies can help ensure more equitable protection against climate-driven disasters.\n\n\n5. Interpretation Boost using marginaleffects\nWind Speed\nAs wind speed increases, the model estimates a higher probability of a fire becoming large (&gt;10 hectares). However, the variability in the predicted probabilities also increases at higher wind speeds, as indicated by the wider confidence intervals. This suggests that while there is a general upward trend, the model’s certainty about the exact magnitude of the effect decreases in this range—likely due to fewer observations or greater variability in fire outcomes at high wind speeds.\n\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\n\nWarning: package 'marginaleffects' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n## continuous variable\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"WIND_SPEED\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nAs temperature increases, the model predicts a relatively stable probability of a fire becoming large. The trend line flattens and the confidence intervals narrow, indicating that the model is more confident and consistent in its estimates across higher temperature ranges. This suggests that the relationship between temperature and fire size is more stable and predictable at higher temperatures, possibly due to a larger number of observations or less variability in outcomes.\n\n## continuous variable \"TEMPERATURE\"\n\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"TEMPERATURE\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Cause\nThe predicted probability of a large fire is near zero for most TRUE_CAUSE categories, indicating that these causes (e.g., natural ignition, campfires, equipment use) are generally not associated with large-scale fires. However, the category “Insufficient Resources” stands out with a significantly higher predicted probability and a wide confidence interval. This suggests that fires classified under this cause are much more likely to become large, though the wide interval reflects substantial uncertainty — likely due to a small number of observations in that category.\n\n## categorical variable \"TRUE_CAUSE\"\nplot_predictions(model, by = \"TRUE_CAUSE\") +\n  ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Probability of Large Fire by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Agent Type\nAlthough fires detected by AIR agents appear more likely to become large, the model is relatively uncertain about this pattern. The wide confidence interval indicates that this result should be interpreted cautiously, and may reflect data sparsity or high variability in fire outcomes for AIR-detected cases.\n\n## categorical variable \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\n)"

However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency.\nWe can also examine how ofter foucple flirt with or fight with their partners. The data indicates a skew towards lower frequencies for both flirting and fighting.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Ordinal Logistic Regression\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates. We will also focus only on statistically significant estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables (sex_frequency, flirts_with_partner and fights_with_partner) affect the perception of relationship quality, additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same_sex_couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + sex_frequency + flirts_with_partner + fights_with_partner,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- cbind(tidy(ordinal_model),\n  p.value = pnorm(abs(tidy(ordinal_model)$statistic), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model |&gt;\n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt; 0.05, \n         coef.type == \"coefficient\")\n\n                                                    term estimate std.error\n1 sex_frequency2_to_3_times_a_month-once_a_month_or_less     0.61      0.15\n2    flirts_with_partneronce_a_week-1_to_3_times_a_month    -0.68      0.32\n3        flirts_with_partnerevery_day-a_few_times_a_week     0.80      0.27\n4                      fights_with_partner1_time-0_times    -0.62      0.14\n  statistic   coef.type p.value exp_estimate\n1      4.07 coefficient    0.00    1.8404314\n2     -2.15 coefficient    0.03    0.5066170\n3      2.98 coefficient    0.00    2.2255409\n4     -4.50 coefficient    0.00    0.5379444\n\n\nNote that fitting our model triggered a warning. This is caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations.A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables. For now, we will only acknowledge this issue.\nPositive estimates are associated with higher relationship quality, while negative estimates are associated with lower relationship quality. Additionally, the exponential of the estimate is the odds ratio, which represents how much the odds of having a higher relationship_quality level changes between levels.\nWe can interpret these estimates:\n\nsame_sex_couple: There is no statistical evidence that being part of a same-sex couple has an association with the perceived relationship quality.\nsex_frequency: People who have sex 2-3 times a month have 1.8 higher odds of reporting better relationship quality that those who have sex once a month or less.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting once per week vs 1-3 times per month is associated with a 49% lower odds of better relationship quality. This is a bit unexpected.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting every day vs a few times per week is associated with 2.3 higher odds of better relationship quality.\nfights_with_partner: Fighting once vs none is associated with 47% lower odds of better relationship quality.\n\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on demographic, behavioral, COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject.\nBased on the calculated estimates, we would think that people who have more sex, flirt more and fight less would perceive a better relationship_quality. We can test this premise:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"no\",\n  sex_frequency = \"once_a_month_or_less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"never\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"7_or_more_times\"), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.05      0.25      0.42      0.25      0.03 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"no\",\n  sex_frequency = \"once_or_more_a_day\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"every_day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"0_times\"), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.01      0.10      0.89 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a different-sex couple who has sex once a month or less, that never flirt with their partner, and that fought with their partner 7 or more times in the last week, have a 42% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair. On the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex once or more per day, that flirts with their partner on a daily basis and that has not fought with their partner in the last week, has an 89% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent.\n\n\n5. Proportional Odds Assumption\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption. To do so, we can use the Brant-Wald test, which assesses whether our model fulfills this assumption.\n\nbt &lt;- brant(ordinal_model)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nWarning in brant(ordinal_model): 2118 combinations in table(dv,ivs) do not\noccur.

Approaching these Brant-Wald test results with caution is advised, or binning categories together may help solve the concern.\nNote that with an \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), we are completely fulfilling the proportional odds assumption (the column probability delivers the corresponding p-values).\nAlso, note that throughout the analysis we got a few warnings. These are caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations. These gaps may affect Brant statistics. A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how sex frequency, flirting and fighting relate to perceived relationship quality for different types of couples. Through the analysis, we could note that relationship behaviors play a key role in how individuals assess their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following from this exercise:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively. Being part of a same-sex couple did not have a statistically significant impact on the perceived relationship quality\nSome effects might not be linear: Not all statistically significant estimates led to better outcomes. Interestingly, flirting once a week was associated with a lower perceived relationship quality than flirting 1-3 times a month.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models.\nInterpretation is key: Having ordinal explanatory variables poses a challenge in interpretation of model estimates. Using the right contrasts supports model interpretation.\nSparsity may affect results: Having many levels in our categories may lead to sparsity in the combination of explanatory variables to all levels of the response variable. Caution is advised in these cases."

Discussion\nThe logistic regression model revealed that higher wind speeds are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of a fire becoming large (over 10 hectares), consistent with our expectations about fire spread dynamics.\nSurprisingly, temperature showed a small negative association with fire size, though this may be influenced by interactions with other environmental factors like humidity or fuel type.\nAmong causes, “Insufficient Resources” and “Line Impact” were associated with significantly higher odds of large fires. This suggests that both human-related limitations and infrastructure vulnerability (like power lines) play a role in fire escalation.\nThe detection agent type showed weak evidence that fires detected by UNP agents may be less likely to become large, compared to FPD Staff, but the effect was not statistically strong (p = 0.09). Further exploration is needed here, especially considering the early intervention ability of different detection teams.\nThese findings provide insights into key environmental and operational factors influencing wildfire severity. Importantly, they point to the need for targeted mitigation strategies in areas with poor detection access or high infrastructure risks.\nIn the broader context of equity, this analysis reinforces that resource constraints and delayed detection—often more common in remote or underfunded regions—can amplify wildfire impacts. Data-informed strategies can help ensure more equitable protection against climate-driven disasters.\n\n\n5. Interpretation Boost using marginaleffects\nWind Speed\nAs wind speed increases, the model estimates a higher probability of a fire becoming large (&gt;10 hectares). However, the variability in the predicted probabilities also increases at higher wind speeds, as indicated by the wider confidence intervals. This suggests that while there is a general upward trend, the model’s certainty about the exact magnitude of the effect decreases in this range—likely due to fewer observations or greater variability in fire outcomes at high wind speeds.\n\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\n\nWarning: package 'marginaleffects' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n## continuous variable\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"WIND_SPEED\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nAs temperature increases, the model predicts a relatively stable probability of a fire becoming large. The trend line flattens and the confidence intervals narrow, indicating that the model is more confident and consistent in its estimates across higher temperature ranges. This suggests that the relationship between temperature and fire size is more stable and predictable at higher temperatures, possibly due to a larger number of observations or less variability in outcomes.\n\n## continuous variable \"TEMPERATURE\"\n\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"TEMPERATURE\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Cause\nThe predicted probability of a large fire is near zero for most TRUE_CAUSE categories, indicating that these causes (e.g., natural ignition, campfires, equipment use) are generally not associated with large-scale fires. However, the category “Insufficient Resources” stands out with a significantly higher predicted probability and a wide confidence interval. This suggests that fires classified under this cause are much more likely to become large, though the wide interval reflects substantial uncertainty — likely due to a small number of observations in that category.\n\n## categorical variable \"TRUE_CAUSE\"\nplot_predictions(model, by = \"TRUE_CAUSE\") +\n  ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Probability of Large Fire by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Agent Type\nAlthough fires detected by AIR agents appear more likely to become large, the model is relatively uncertain about this pattern. The wide confidence interval indicates that this result should be interpreted cautiously, and may reflect data sparsity or high variability in fire outcomes for AIR-detected cases.\n\n## categorical variable \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\n)"

    "text": "About the Data\nThis data set is adapted from the original data set How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017, 2022 survey, collected by Stanford University researchers. The data set explores the dynamics of relationships among adults in the United States, with data points gathered from subjects in 2017, 2020 and 2022. This adapted data set focuses on variables that may affect the quality of the relationship, considering demographic characteristics of the subjects, as well as the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on romantic relationships in the United States. This data set enables exploration of how external factors, like the health of the subjects and income changes, as well as personal behaviors, like conflict and intimate dynamics, relate to an individual’s perception of the quality of the relationship.\nThis analysis contributes to discussions around partnership resilience, healthy relationships, and how norms around sexuality and technology shape romantic relationships.\n\nKey Features of the Dataset\nEach row in the data set represents an individual subject and includes the following selected variables:\n\nSubject demographics: age, sex, ethnicity, education level, income level, and employment status\nRelationship context: whether the subject is part of a same-sex relationship, whether they are married, the duration of the relationship and how many children are in the household.\nCouple behavior indicators: sex, flirting and fighting frequency.\nPandemic Variables: interpreted impact of the pandemic in the relationship, income change during the pandemic, if the subject and their partner were sick with COVID-19 and if they were vaccinated.\nQuality of the relationship: variable used to measure the subject’s perceived quality of their relationship.\n\n\n\nPurpose and Use Cases\nThis data set supports investigations into:\n\nDemographic and behavioral predictors of relationship quality.\nHow the pandemic experience affected relationships.\nDifferences in relationship dynamics between different levels of income, sex and sexual orientation."

Variable Encoding\nWe can note that our categorical response follows a specific order. For this reason, we require a model that suits ordinal responses. Hence, we will be using an Ordinal Logistic regression model framework.\nIn order to do so, we need to make sure that our response variable is encoded as an ordered factor. We will also take this opportunity to encode all our explanatory variables as factors (and ordered factors) as needed, even if we will not use all of them in our exercise.\n\n# First, we can encode our nomical categorical explanatory variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(same_sex_couple = as_factor(same_sex_couple))\n\nlevels(hcmst$same_sex_couple)\n\n[1] \"no\"  \"yes\"\n\n\n\n# Then, we can encode all our ordinal categorical explanatory variables:\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = as.ordered(sex_frequency)) |&gt; \n  mutate(sex_frequency = fct_relevel(\n    sex_frequency, \n    c(\n      \"once_a_month_or_less\", \n      \"2_to_3_times_a_month\", \n      \"once_or_twice_a_week\", \n      \"3_to_6_times_a_week\", \n      \"once_or_more_a_day\"\n      )\n    ))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(flirts_with_partner = as.ordered(flirts_with_partner)) |&gt; \n  mutate(flirts_with_partner = fct_relevel(\n    flirts_with_partner, \n    c(\n      \"never\", \n      \"less_than_once_a_month\", \n      \"1_to_3_times_a_month\", \n      \"once_a_week\", \n      \"a_few_times_a_week\", \n      \"every_day\"\n      )\n    ))\n\nlevels(hcmst$flirts_with_partner)\n\n[1] \"never\"                  \"less_than_once_a_month\" \"1_to_3_times_a_month\"  \n[4] \"once_a_week\"            \"a_few_times_a_week\"     \"every_day\"             \n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(fights_with_partner = as.ordered(fights_with_partner)) |&gt; \n  mutate(fights_with_partner = fct_relevel(\n    fights_with_partner, \n    c(\n      \"0_times\", \n      \"1_time\", \n      \"2_times\", \n      \"3_times\", \n      \"4_times\", \n      \"5_times\", \n      \"6_times\", \n      \"7_or_more_times\"\n      )\n    ))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\n\n\nhcmst &lt;- hcmst |&gt; \n  mutate(relationship_quality = as.ordered(relationship_quality)) |&gt; \n  mutate(relationship_quality = fct_relevel(\n    relationship_quality, \n    c(\n      \"very_poor\", \n      \"poor\", \n      \"fair\", \n      \"good\", \n      \"excellent\"\n      )\n    ))\n\nlevels(hcmst$sex_frequency)\n\n[1] \"once_a_month_or_less\" \"2_to_3_times_a_month\" \"once_or_twice_a_week\"\n[4] \"3_to_6_times_a_week\"  \"once_or_more_a_day\"  \n\nhead(hcmst)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  same_sex_couple sex_frequency        flirts_with_partner   fights_with_partner\n  &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;ord&gt;                &lt;ord&gt;                 &lt;ord&gt;              \n1 no              once_or_twice_a_week a_few_times_a_week    0_times            \n2 no              once_a_month_or_less never                 7_or_more_times    \n3 no              once_or_twice_a_week a_few_times_a_week    2_times            \n4 no              once_or_twice_a_week 1_to_3_times_a_month  0_times            \n5 no              once_or_twice_a_week a_few_times_a_week    0_times            \n6 no              once_a_month_or_less less_than_once_a_mon… 1_time             \n# ℹ 1 more variable: relationship_quality &lt;ord&gt;\n\n\n\n\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis\nLet’s visualize histograms charts for our different categorical variables to see how different groups were sampled in the survey and how different these samples are for same sex couples.\nFirst, we will create a function that will be used for visualization.\n\nhistogram_plot &lt;- function(data, y_var, facet, plot_title = \"Counts by Category\") {\n\n  data_long &lt;- data |&gt; \n    dplyr::select(all_of(c(y_var, facet))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = all_of(y_var), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt; \n    count(var, value, facet_value = .data[[facet]])\n\n  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = n, y = reorder(value, n), fill = facet_value)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n    labs(\n      title = plot_title,\n      x = \"Count\",\n      y = NULL,\n      fill = facet\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",)\n}\n\n\nhist_sex_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"sex_frequency\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Sex Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_flirt_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"flirts_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Flirting Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_fight_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"fights_with_partner\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Fighting Frequency\"\n)\n\nhist_quality_freq &lt;- histogram_plot(\n  hcmst, \n  \"relationship_quality\", \n  \"same_sex_couple\", \n  plot_title = \"Relationship Quality Frequency\"\n)\n\nplot_grid(\n  hist_sex_freq, \n  hist_flirt_freq, \n  hist_fight_freq, \n  hist_quality_freq, \n  ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the sample of same_sex_couples is significantly smaller that that of different-sex couples..\nSame-sex and different-sex couples show similar patters in how frequently they engage in sexual activity. However, the overall sample is skewed towards reporting low sex frequency.\nWe can also examine how ofter foucple flirt with or fight with their partners. The data indicates a skew towards lower frequencies for both flirting and fighting.\nAs for our target variable, most participants perceived the quality of their relationship to be good or excellent.\n\n\n4. Ordinal Logistic Regression\nWe will be assuming and fitting a proportional odds model, which assumes that the log-odds of being in a higher category of the response variable follows a linear relationship with the explanatory variables.\nFor our modeling purposes, we will use the MASS package, polr() function to obtain model estimates.\nGiven that we are using ordinal categorical variables as explanatory variables, we will also set our model to use successive differences contrasts to facilitate the interpretation of the estimates.\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.sdif\"))\n\nNow, we can fit our model. Noting that polr() does not calculate p-values, we can compute them and bind them to our model estimates. We will also focus only on statistically significant estimates.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will only use a subset of the variables in our modeling. We will be interested in how behavioral variables (sex_frequency, flirts_with_partner and fights_with_partner) affect the perception of relationship quality, additionally, we are interested in seeing if these effects are different for same_sex_couples.\n\nordinal_model &lt;- polr(\n  relationship_quality ~ same_sex_couple + sex_frequency + flirts_with_partner + fights_with_partner,\n  data = hcmst, Hess = TRUE\n)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model &lt;- cbind(tidy(ordinal_model),\n  p.value = pnorm(abs(tidy(ordinal_model)$statistic), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)\n\nsummary_partial_ordinal_model |&gt;\n  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt; \n  filter(p.value &lt; 0.05, \n         coef.type == \"coefficient\")\n\n                                                    term estimate std.error\n1 sex_frequency2_to_3_times_a_month-once_a_month_or_less     0.61      0.15\n2    flirts_with_partneronce_a_week-1_to_3_times_a_month    -0.68      0.32\n3        flirts_with_partnerevery_day-a_few_times_a_week     0.80      0.27\n4                      fights_with_partner1_time-0_times    -0.62      0.14\n  statistic   coef.type p.value exp_estimate\n1      4.07 coefficient    0.00    1.8404314\n2     -2.15 coefficient    0.03    0.5066170\n3      2.98 coefficient    0.00    2.2255409\n4     -4.50 coefficient    0.00    0.5379444\n\n\nNote that fitting our model triggered a warning. This is caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations.A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables. For now, we will only acknowledge this issue.\nPositive estimates are associated with higher relationship quality, while negative estimates are associated with lower relationship quality. Additionally, the exponential of the estimate is the odds ratio, which represents how much the odds of having a higher relationship_quality level changes between levels.\nWe can interpret these estimates:\n\nsame_sex_couple: There is no statistical evidence that being part of a same-sex couple has an association with the perceived relationship quality.\nsex_frequency: People who have sex 2-3 times a month have 1.8 higher odds of reporting better relationship quality that those who have sex once a month or less.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting once per week vs 1-3 times per month is associated with a 49% lower odds of better relationship quality. This is a bit unexpected.\nflirts_with_partner: Flirting every day vs a few times per week is associated with 2.3 higher odds of better relationship quality.\nfights_with_partner: Fighting once vs none is associated with 47% lower odds of better relationship quality.\n\nWith our fitted model, we are now able to make predictions on new examples. Based on demographic, behavioral, COVID-19 related variables, we can predict the probabilities of the different levels of perceived relationship_quality for a specific subject.\nBased on the calculated estimates, we would think that people who have more sex, flirt more and fight less would perceive a better relationship_quality. We can test this premise:\n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"no\",\n  sex_frequency = \"once_a_month_or_less\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"never\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"7_or_more_times\"), \n  type = \"probs\"),2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.05      0.25      0.42      0.25      0.03 \n\nround(predict(ordinal_model, tibble(\n  same_sex_couple = \"no\",\n  sex_frequency = \"once_or_more_a_day\",\n  flirts_with_partner = \"every_day\",\n  fights_with_partner = \"0_times\"), \n  type = \"probs\"), 2)\n\nvery_poor      poor      fair      good excellent \n     0.00      0.00      0.01      0.10      0.89 \n\n\nWe can note that a subject involved in a different-sex couple who has sex once a month or less, that never flirt with their partner, and that fought with their partner 7 or more times in the last week, have a 42% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as fair. On the other hand, a subject involved in a different-sex couple, who has sex once or more per day, that flirts with their partner on a daily basis and that has not fought with their partner in the last week, has an 89% probability of perceiving their relationship quality as excellent.\n\n\n5. Proportional Odds Assumption\nTo ensure the validity of our analysis, we are going to test the proportional odds assumption. To do so, we can use the Brant-Wald test, which assesses whether our model fulfills this assumption.\n\nbt &lt;- brant(ordinal_model)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\n\nWarning in brant(ordinal_model): 2118 combinations in table(dv,ivs) do not\noccur.

Approaching these Brant-Wald test results with caution is advised, or binning categories together may help solve the concern.\nNote that with an \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), we are completely fulfilling the proportional odds assumption (the column probability delivers the corresponding p-values).\nAlso, note that throughout the analysis we got a few warnings. These are caused by having categories in our model that are quite sparse, where combinations of the response and the levels of the predictor have no observations. These gaps may affect Brant statistics. A solution for this matter would be to bin some of the levels of our categories to avoid having empty combinations of levels between our response and explanatory variables.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis explored how sex frequency, flirting and fighting relate to perceived relationship quality for different types of couples. Through the analysis, we could note that relationship behaviors play a key role in how individuals assess their relationships. More specifically, we could conclude the following from this exercise:\n\nBehaviors are important: More frequent sex and flirting are associated with higher perceived relationship quality, while more frequent fighting affects that perception negatively. Being part of a same-sex couple did not have a statistically significant impact on the perceived relationship quality\nSome effects might not be linear: Not all statistically significant estimates led to better outcomes. Interestingly, flirting once a week was associated with a lower perceived relationship quality than flirting 1-3 times a month.\nEncoding and model choice are critical: Model selection is tied to the type of response variable. Ordinal categorical response variables are tied to ordinal logistic regression models.\nInterpretation is key: Having ordinal explanatory variables poses a challenge in interpretation of model estimates. Using the right contrasts supports model interpretation.\nSparsity may affect results: Having many levels in our categories may lead to sparsity in the combination of explanatory variables to all levels of the response variable. Caution is advised in these cases."

Sourced from official NCAA, the adapted data set captures tournament results across more than four decades of collegiate women’s basketball.\nThe rise in popularity of the NCAA Women’s March Madness, fueled by athletes like Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers, reflects a broader cultural shift in the recognition of women’s sports. Beyond entertainment and athletic achievement, women’s participation in sport has social and professional benefits.\nAs Beth A. Brooke notes in her article Here’s Why Women Who Play Sports Are More Successful, research from EY shows that 94% of women in executive leadership roles played sports, and over half competed at the university level. Participation in sports hel develop skills such as resilience, teamwork, and competitiveness, traits that critical for career success.\nAnalyzing NCAA Women’s March Madness results and promoting visibility of women in sports, beyond exercising our data skills, supports advocation for equity, opportunity, and empowerment of women in leadership.\n\nKey Features of the Dataset\nEach row represents a single team’s appearance in a specific tournament year and includes information such as:\n\nTournament Seed – Seed assigned to the team\nTournament Results – Number of wins, losses, and how far the team advanced\nBid Type – Whether the team received an automatic bid or was selected at-large.\nSeason Records – Regular season, conference, and total win/loss stats and percentages\nConference Information – Team’s conference name, record, and rank within the conference\nDivision – Regional placement in the tournament bracket (e.g., East, West)\nHome Game Indication – Whether the team played its first game at home\n\n\n\nPurpose and Use Cases\nThis dataset is designed to support analysis of:\n\nTeam performance over time\nImpact of seeding and bid types on tournament results\nConference strength\nEmergence and decline of winning teams in women’s college basketball"

In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance. But upsets, bracket surprises, and standout performances from lower seeds raise questions like “How reliable is seeding as a predictor of success?”\nUnderstanding these dynamics can inform fan expectations and bracket predictions.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n0.

Hypothesis Testing: Are Seed and Wins Associated?\n\\(H_0\\)(Null): Seed and tournament wins are not associated\n\\(H_a\\)(Alternative): Seed and tournament wins are associated\n\ncorrelation_test &lt;- tidy(\n  cor.test(\n      marchmadness$seed, \n      marchmadness$tourney_wins, \n      method = \"spearman\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 3)\n\nkable(correlation_test, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n-0.72\n2602468566\n0\nSpearman’s rank correlation rho\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can note that from this correlation test, with a P-value below 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis, denoting that seed and wins are likely associated. The strong negative Spearman’s rho suggests that lower seeds tend to win significantly more tournament games, as was confirmed from our exploratory analysis.\nThis can be visualized with the following plot:\n\nggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Seed vs Tournament Wins\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we can note that given that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\nkable(tidy(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.45\n0.04\n40.41\n0\n\n\nseed\n-0.26\n0.01\n-35.97\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarchmadness$predicted_wins &lt;- predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\")\n\nmodel_plot &lt;- ggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_wins), color = \"skyblue2\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Poisson Regression: Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nmodel_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed coefficient \\(\\beta_1 = -0.2501\\) represents the log change in the expected number of tournament wins for every 1 unit increase in seed.\n\nexp(poisson_model$coefficients[\"seed\"])\n\n     seed \n0.7709619 \n\n\nThis means that for every increase in seed by 1, the expected tournament wins decreases by about 23% ( as 1-0.77 = 0.23)\n\n\n4. Overdispersion Testing\nIt is noteworthy that Poisson assumes that the mean is equal to the variance of the count variable. If the variance is much greater, we might need a Negative Binomial model. We can do an dispersion test to evaluate this matter.\nLetting \\(Y_i\\) be the \\(ith\\) Poisson response in the count regression model, in the presence of equidispersion, \\(Y_i\\) has the following parameters:\n\\(E(Y_i)=\\lambda_i, Var(Y_i)=\\lambda_i\\)\nThe test uses the following mathematical expression (using a \\(1+\\gamma\\) dispersion factor):\n\\(Var(Y_i)=(1+\\gamma)*\\lambda_i\\)\nwith the hypotheses:\n\\(H_0:1 + \\gamma = 1\\)\n\\(H_a: 1 + \\gamma &gt; 1\\)\nWhen there is evidence of overdispersion in our data, we will reject \\(H_o\\).\n\nkable(tidy(dispersiontest(poisson_model)), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n0.95\n-1.01\n0.84\nOverdispersion test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the P-value (0.8437) is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant evidence of overdispersion in the Poisson model.\n\n\n5. One Major Assumption…\nNote that throughout this analysis, we’ve made one big assumption: we have used seed as a numeric predictor. This assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\n\nclass(marchmadness$seed)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nTo test if this assumption is appropraite, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed.\nWe can create an equivalent Poisson model, but now, we can treat seed as a factor.\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ as.factor(as.character(seed)), family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\nkable(tidy(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.25\n0.04\n28.43\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))10\n-2.11\n0.14\n-14.97\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))11\n-2.08\n0.15\n-14.33\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))12\n-2.73\n0.19\n-14.06\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))13\n-3.65\n0.34\n-10.84\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))14\n-19.55\n574.63\n-0.03\n0.97\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))15\n-19.55\n571.75\n-0.03\n0.97\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))16\n-4.48\n0.50\n-8.92\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))2\n-0.34\n0.07\n-4.96\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))3\n-0.66\n0.08\n-8.83\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))4\n-0.80\n0.08\n-10.11\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))5\n-1.25\n0.09\n-13.46\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))6\n-1.41\n0.10\n-14.15\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))7\n-1.57\n0.11\n-14.84\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))8\n-1.91\n0.13\n-15.25\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))9\n-1.87\n0.13\n-14.72\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, is we wanted to formally evaluate which is the better approach we could use likelihood-based model selection tools.\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2117.42\n4238.84\n4250.12\n1610.34\n2082\n2084\n\n\n\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2079.52\n4191.04\n4281.31\n1534.54\n2068\n2084\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on lower residual deviance, higher log-likelihood, and a lower AIC, the model that treats seed as a factor fits the data better. This would suggest that the relationship between tournament seed and number of wins is not linear, and would support using an approach that does not assume a constant effect per unit change in seed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis examined the relationship between a team’s tournament seed and its performance in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament. The results suggest that:\n\nSeed strongly predicts performance: Lower-numbered seeds (higher-ranked teams) tend to win more games on average. The correlation between seed and wins was statistically significant, with higher seeds associated with fewer wins.\nPoisson regression supports seeding as a predictor: The Poisson regression model confirmed that seed is a significant predictor of tournament wins, as expected for a count variable like wins.\nModel assumptions are key: Treating seed as a numeric variable assumes a linear effect across all seed values, which oversimplifies the relationship with the outcome. Ensuring that explanatory variables are approapriately coded is key. In this case, the influence of seeds could be described as slightly non-linear, which opens the door to discussion over model selection.\nThere is a lot of variation around the prediction: While seeding generally reflects team strength, upsets and unexpected performances do occur, showing that other factors also influence tournament outcomes.\n\nSeeding is an important predictor of success, but clearly other factors influence the results. It sets expectations, but unexpected performances still shape March Madness."

In theory, lower-numbered seeds (e.g., #1, #2) are given to the strongest teams, who should be more likely to advance.

The strong negative Spearman’s rho suggests that lower seeds tend to win significantly more tournament games, as was confirmed from our exploratory analysis.\nThis can be visualized with the following plot:\n\nggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"skyblue2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Seed vs Tournament Wins\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we can note that given that we’re setting tourney_wins as a response, our linear regression model may output negative values at high seed values. Therefore, a Poisson Regression model is better suited, considering that tourney wins is a count variable and is always non-negative.\n\npoisson_model &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ seed, family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\nkable(tidy(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.45\n0.04\n40.41\n0\n\n\nseed\n-0.26\n0.01\n-35.97\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarchmadness$predicted_wins &lt;- predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\")\n\nmodel_plot &lt;- ggplot(marchmadness, aes(x = seed, y = tourney_wins)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_wins), color = \"skyblue2\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Poisson Regression: Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Tournament Wins\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nmodel_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed coefficient \\(\\beta_1 = -0.2501\\) represents the log change in the expected number of tournament wins for every 1 unit increase in seed.\n\nexp(poisson_model$coefficients[\"seed\"])\n\n     seed \n0.7709619 \n\n\nThis means that for every increase in seed by 1, the expected tournament wins decreases by about 23% ( as 1-0.77 = 0.23)\n\n\n4. Overdispersion Testing\nIt is noteworthy that Poisson assumes that the mean is equal to the variance of the count variable. If the variance is much greater, we might need a Negative Binomial model. We can do an dispersion test to evaluate this matter.\nLetting \\(Y_i\\) be the \\(ith\\) Poisson response in the count regression model, in the presence of equidispersion, \\(Y_i\\) has the following parameters:\n\\(E(Y_i)=\\lambda_i, Var(Y_i)=\\lambda_i\\)\nThe test uses the following mathematical expression (using a \\(1+\\gamma\\) dispersion factor):\n\\(Var(Y_i)=(1+\\gamma)*\\lambda_i\\)\nwith the hypotheses:\n\\(H_0:1 + \\gamma = 1\\)\n\\(H_a: 1 + \\gamma &gt; 1\\)\nWhen there is evidence of overdispersion in our data, we will reject \\(H_o\\).\n\nkable(tidy(dispersiontest(poisson_model)), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n0.95\n-1.01\n0.84\nOverdispersion test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the P-value (0.8437) is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant evidence of overdispersion in the Poisson model.\n\n\n5. One Major Assumption…\nNote that throughout this analysis, we’ve made one big assumption: we have used seed as a numeric predictor. This assumes that the effect of seed is linear on the log scaled of the amount of tourney_wins.\n\nclass(marchmadness$seed)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nTo test if this assumption is appropraite, we can compare models that make different assumptions about seed.\nWe can create an equivalent Poisson model, but now, we can treat seed as a factor.\n\npoisson_model_factor &lt;- glm(tourney_wins ~ as.factor(as.character(seed)), family = \"poisson\", data = marchmadness)\n\nkable(tidy(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.25\n0.04\n28.43\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))10\n-2.11\n0.14\n-14.97\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))11\n-2.08\n0.15\n-14.33\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))12\n-2.73\n0.19\n-14.06\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))13\n-3.65\n0.34\n-10.84\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))14\n-19.55\n574.63\n-0.03\n0.97\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))15\n-19.55\n571.75\n-0.03\n0.97\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))16\n-4.48\n0.50\n-8.92\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))2\n-0.34\n0.07\n-4.96\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))3\n-0.66\n0.08\n-8.83\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))4\n-0.80\n0.08\n-10.11\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))5\n-1.25\n0.09\n-13.46\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))6\n-1.41\n0.10\n-14.15\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))7\n-1.57\n0.11\n-14.84\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))8\n-1.91\n0.13\n-15.25\n0.00\n\n\nas.factor(as.character(seed))9\n-1.87\n0.13\n-14.72\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can visualize how the two models fit the data to evaluate if treating seed as numeric or factor would have a significant impact on our modelling process.\n\nmarchmadness &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Numeric_Seed = predict(poisson_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Factor_Seed = predict(poisson_model_factor, type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nplot_data &lt;- marchmadness |&gt; \n  select(seed, tourney_wins, Numeric_Seed, Factor_Seed) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Numeric_Seed\",\"Factor_Seed\"), names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"predicted\")\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = seed, y = predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tourney_wins), alpha = 0.3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Tournament Wins by Seed\",\n       x = \"Seed\",\n       y = \"Predicted Wins\",\n       color = \"Model\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, is we wanted to formally evaluate which is the better approach we could use likelihood-based model selection tools.\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2117.42\n4238.84\n4250.12\n1610.34\n2082\n2084\n\n\n\n\nkable(glance(poisson_model_factor), digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull.deviance\ndf.null\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n3438.76\n2083\n-2079.52\n4191.04\n4281.31\n1534.54\n2068\n2084\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on lower residual deviance, higher log-likelihood, and a lower AIC, the model that treats seed as a factor fits the data better. This would suggest that the relationship between tournament seed and number of wins is not linear, and would support using an approach that does not assume a constant effect per unit change in seed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis analysis examined the relationship between a team’s tournament seed and its performance in the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Tournament. The results suggest that:\n\nSeed strongly predicts performance: Lower-numbered seeds (higher-ranked teams) tend to win more games on average. The correlation between seed and wins was statistically significant, with higher seeds associated with fewer wins.\nPoisson regression supports seeding as a predictor: The Poisson regression model confirmed that seed is a significant predictor of tournament wins, as expected for a count variable like wins.\nModel assumptions are key: Treating seed as a numeric variable assumes a linear effect across all seed values, which oversimplifies the relationship with the outcome. Ensuring that explanatory variables are approapriately coded is key. In this case, the influence of seeds could be described as slightly non-linear, which opens the door to discussion over model selection.\nThere is a lot of variation around the prediction: While seeding generally reflects team strength, upsets and unexpected performances do occur, showing that other factors also influence tournament outcomes.\n\nSeeding is an important predictor of success, but clearly other factors influence the results. It sets expectations, but unexpected performances still shape March Madness."
