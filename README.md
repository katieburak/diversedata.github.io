# Diverse Data Hub

Welcome to the Diverse Data Hub repository! ðŸ‘‹ This project creates a user-friendly data repository featuring datasets centered on a wide range of diverse topics, including EDI-related data. By curating freely available and open-source data, the repository provides users with an accessible resource to explore diverse and meaningful topics in their work or studies. 

The datasets will be easily accessible through an open-access website and as R and Python packages, enabling seamless integration into the workflows of students, educators, and practitioners. Along with the datasets, there are example case studies that showcase various types of data science questions, offering users motivation and practical inspiration for incorporating these topics into their work. Information about each dataset, along with its contextual relevance, is also documented to promote connections to real-world issues and stimulate meaningful discussions.
